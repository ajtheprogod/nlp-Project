  <Question id="20100318194410AAJw7qy" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Where online can I find...?</Subject>
    <Content>A site that allows me to create a free, downloadable, fill-in-the blank form? Not the kind you print out and fill in... the kind I can put on my website and people can download it, save it on their desk top, use their computers to fill in the blanks, and then email it to me? I can create PDF ones but they never let you fill in the blanks... does anyone know a good site that allows you to create these? THANKS!
I can create a web form, but that is not what I want here- I need something LIKE a PDF form- so my visitors can download it- BUT I need them to be able to fill in the blanks WITHOUT PRINTING THE FORM so tehy can email it back to me. It is a LONG application and questionaire- several pages- so I do not want one that has to be printed nor do I want to use a web form. I can create it as a PDF or using Office- but when I test it, it will not let me type in the blanks- I need people to be able to type in the blanks on a downloadable form... any suggestions?
