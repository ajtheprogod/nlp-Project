    <ChosenAnswer>It doesn&#039;t matter at all. There&#039;s no restrictions. I&#039;d suggest you to try iPage. I have use the web hosting service from iPage after reading reviews on WebhostingBreak. Their pricing is extremely competitive, with many custom packaging to meet your hosting needs. I&#039;m happy with their services. I recommend the hosting &amp; domain services from them. http://www.webhostingbreak.com/ipage-coupon/</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>i think it doesn&#039;t matter where you host your site, if you steal someone&#039;s copyrighted content, they can sue you if they want to.

but i recommend that you find hosting company in your country just in case if you have issues wiith your hosting company, you can call them and work with them.  if they are in foreign country, sometimes it&#039;s difficult to deal with them while you are here.

            <Content>Take into consideration that web hosting is a global service. It does not matter what country you are located in; US, UK, Canada, Australia or India. It is good to note that the cost of hosting services in most countries is generally a little more expensive in comparison to the same services in Canada and the United States. Specifically, American web hosts offer a much better value for money than any local hosting.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I’m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting &amp; I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.
