  <Question id="20100304173558AAlB89c" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Someone has filed a paypal claim against me, but I have no proof that I sent the item. What should I do?</Subject>
    <Content>I sold a gift card to an ebay user in Canada. I just bought a stamp and stuck it in an envelope. So I have no proof that I ever shipped it out, but I definitely did. I have had no previous problems sending gift card this way, and I concealed the card between two index cards and put it in a security envelope. It must have gotten lost in the mail or the buyer is lying. What can I do?

    <ChosenAnswer>Unfortunately there is nothing you can do, paypal will side with the buyer so I would refund them. has the claim been escalated to paypal yet? If not - refund them willingly otherwise Paypal will not only take the amount that the buyer has paid, they will charge you a fee!
Always send items through a trackable/signature delivery without a tracking number you dont stand a chance to win.
As a seller you are responsible to ensure the item reaches the buyer.</ChosenAnswer>
