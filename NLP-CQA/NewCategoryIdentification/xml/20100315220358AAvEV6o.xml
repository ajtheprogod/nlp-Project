    <ChosenAnswer>It shouldn&#039;t change your internet speed.
However...
Adblock for chrome is NOT the same as Firefox&#039;s adblock plus.
Ads are loaded then hidden from view since Google chrome can&#039;t support an adblocker that actually blocks ads. 
If you really want to block ads from even loading, use SWR Iron (chromium developer build) instead.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>No, it will actually speed it up. All of the ads that have animations will make your internet slow, but adblock takes them away =). Adblock actually increased the speed when i stream videos by taking the ads off.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>There are MANY reasons for computer slow downs:
 not enough memory
 too many programs starting up with windows at boot up time
 too many junk files
 too many restore points

Clean windows registry can speed up the computer.
Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software&#039;s, install new devices, 
download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system.
This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. 
Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.
Clean registry make pc faster.
