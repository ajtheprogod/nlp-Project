  <Question id="20100312180628AAYCCYr" type="Answered">
    <Subject>The page cannot be displayed?</Subject>
    <Content>Server cannot be found.             

 What does all that exactly mean?  I know the web site is real(it is the local news station website and they just gave it less than 15 minutes ago.      I first tried to find it with FireFox, then I.E., then Opera.   Results are always the same .      I have always let it go (normally because I can find the web site (in this case I refer to other web sites that give me a problem- not many, but there is a few.)
     I am running Win XP Pro

Also, I am typing  in the web site address ( in this case chbcnews.ca) (and then varied it by typing in http://www.chbcnews.ca and still the same problem)
