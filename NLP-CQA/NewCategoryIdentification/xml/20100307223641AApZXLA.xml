  <Question id="20100307223641AApZXLA" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why do none of my browsers work except firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>I have IE, Chrome, and Safari and none of them work. They all say that they can&#039;t load the page. Same thing with apps like Yahoo. The only thing that works is Firefox. I thought it might be a virus, but I&#039;ve scanned (with trial version of Norton) and found nothing. I&#039;ve also tried to install SpyBot but it won&#039;t install without connecting to the internet. Any ideas as to what&#039;s going on and how to fix it?

    <ChosenAnswer>it&#039;s not virous because i had the same problem. i think somewhere in the internet option it says proxy server and i think it&#039;s enabled so you can&#039;t use it. just go to internet option and then connections and lan setting and where it says use a proxy server for your lan jus unmark it. nd there you go.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Your computer does not have Internet access. It only has web access, and that only through a proxy. Firefox is configured to use the proxy and the other applications aren&#039;t.</Content>
