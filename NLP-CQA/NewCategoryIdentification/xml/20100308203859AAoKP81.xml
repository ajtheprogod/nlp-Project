    <ChosenAnswer>Hi Ace,

Look at your problem from this perspective:

1) There are more than 113 million blogs in the web. 

2) If you run an ad on a blog, only 2 out of 100 visitors click on that ad.

So no wonder you started a blog and are not receiving any visitor. In such a crowd, is it easy to get found. 

Merely creating a blog is not sufficient. It needs to be promoted and that too promoted well. That&#039;s why companies spend fortune in spreading the word. Use every avenue social networks, your blog etc. to get connected with people. In addition, going by your business requirements, try TEs too. All details on TEs in source url below:</ChosenAnswer>
