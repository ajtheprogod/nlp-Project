  <Question id="20100308133634AAFTsMl" type="Answered">
    <Subject>In DeviantArts, how do you block a member from sending comments to your profile?</Subject>
    <Content>If anyone is kind enough, I want this member &#039;thecamilanunez&#039; banned. She&#039;s stealing my artwork, leaving spamful comments on my profile and trying to give me stories that I think are ridiculous and won&#039;t stop. I tried reporting he deviations, but nothing keeps happening. I want that member permanently banned.

    <ChosenAnswer>You click on &#039;More&#039; on the right next to collections. Click on the &#039;Account Tools&#039;, then &#039;Edit Settings&#039;. And in the general section at the bottom of the page, there should be a box that says &#039;Blocked Users&#039;. :)

Although, you could have went to http://help.deviantart.com/96/.

Also, you can&#039;t ban a user yourself. If you report the stolen artwork, the DA admins will eventually ban &#039;thecamilanunez&#039;. 

Good luck. :)</ChosenAnswer>
