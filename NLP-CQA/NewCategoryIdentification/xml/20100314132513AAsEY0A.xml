    <Subject>Anybody know how I can fix this problem on netflix?</Subject>
    <Content>When I put my instant streaming disc in my ps3 it says &quot;Cannot connect to Netflix.  Please try again later.  If the problem persists, please visit netflix.com/help on your computer.&quot;  Well it&#039;s been doing this for a while and I went to netflix.com/help and it didn&#039;t say anything on how to fix this problem.  Anybody know of a way to fix this?
my ps3 is definitely connected to the internet.  I can still play games online and access the internet.

    <ChosenAnswer>I would guess that this is because you don&#039;t have connectivity on your PS3? Check to make sure that it&#039;s connected to the internet.</ChosenAnswer>
