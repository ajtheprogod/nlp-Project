    <Content>So there will be some students here in Vancouver. Some will be joining us from all over the province. I want to be seen teaching the anatomy by all at home. I might also like to show images from my computer. I may also like to record it to post it for students who missed the class. Please help. I run a mac- but the software so far says it only works with PC. Thanks.

            <Content>Below is free screen sharing webinar application that works with Macs or PCs, it doesn&#039;t do live video, there&#039;s a possibility that some webcam monitor software might show up in the screen share.

For creating canned tutorials on a Mac ScreenFlow ($99) is the best, combining camera feed and screen recording, with the screen cap on a 3D slant.</Content>
