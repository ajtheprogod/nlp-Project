  <Question id="20100302143406AArCSXz" type="Answered">
    <Subject>If you create a blog can anyone read it or can you keep it private.?</Subject>
    <Content>
I want to put pics on my blog.
Yea, where is it.  Good question.  I forgot where I put it.  I am trying to find it.  I forgot where I put the paper that I wrote the info on.
It is on a blogger website.
Another question.  Can I keep certain parts of it private and allow access to other parts.  Like others can read and post info about their bunnies but they can&#039;t access my private stuff?

    <ChosenAnswer>The point is WHERE? 

Well, if you create a blog on blogger.com then I think ya you can set it to private but if you create one yourself, without using any online thirdparty blog creation website, then you may just keep the blog address private or password protect the website so no stranger can access it.</ChosenAnswer>
