    <ChosenAnswer>All online poker is a scam...they are all slightly programmed where the new people or people who put in little money will win for a little bit and then they get you to lose all your money and then try to get you to deposit more money...but also...just cause you watch poker and play poker...it doesn&#039;t make you good when you think AA is the best hand...poker just sums up the good plays for the most part and shows you that &quot;oh wow...AA just tripped&quot;...you have to think about probability and odds of what&#039;s come up and what hasn&#039;t come up yet...it&#039;s worked great for me where &quot;horrible&quot; hands like 8-3 off suit and K-3 off suit have paid off greatly.  I went to the casino twice...and brought with me $40 one time and $35 another time to play poker...went home with 800+ each time...would have been 1600+ once but there&#039;s always a chance where someone chases and chases and catches a larger full house even though you flopped and bet it...*_*...</ChosenAnswer>

            <Reference>they all take your money quickly and easily but will delay on getting it to you and even prohibit you from withdrawing your money...just play for free online...and play $ in real life...besides that...it&#039;s the Patriot act that makes everything much harder to cash out with...except at the casino when you&#039;re below 10k...haha...</Reference>
