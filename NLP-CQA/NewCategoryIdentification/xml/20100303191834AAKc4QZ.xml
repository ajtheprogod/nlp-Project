    <ChosenAnswer>You can use Skype or something similar to do this, but it is only free when you are making a call to the other person&#039;s Skype client. If you want to make calls to someone&#039;s landline or cell phone, you have to pay for the call.  I have not priced it myself, but I believe it is still cheaper to make an international call through Skype than through a cell phone or landline.

            <Content>Stephanie,

Sorry to say there is no such thing as FREE outgoing phone calls,
All so called free phone call sites always have a catch. 

But do not give up.


*** Receive unlimited FREE incoming International calls. ****
You can get a FREE incoming USA Phone Number.
Get ALL your Incoming phone calls FREE.
Make FREE conference calls.
Make unlimited outgoing Toll Free Calls.

You can also BUY your outgoing Minutes for as little as 1.2 cents to 50 countries.

This site tells it ALL:

Good Luck
