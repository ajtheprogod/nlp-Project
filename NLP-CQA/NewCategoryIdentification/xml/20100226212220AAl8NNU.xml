  <Question id="20100226212220AAl8NNU" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is 000space any good?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m thinking about alternative web hosting for my tutorial site, and I&#039;m just wondering how good 000space is. The ratings on free-webhosts.com were disabled, so I&#039;m not sure what to compare it to. Also, does it have an inactivity limit? I didn&#039;t see this on their site...

Please don&#039;t recommend any paid services. I&#039;ve been using free services to build up traffic for my brand and I&#039;m not ready to invest money in it yet. I really could care less if it&#039;s five dollars or even one dollar. No means no.
Guys, I specifically told you I need free. I&#039;m specifically using free services until I get enough traffic to warrant an upgrade. I&#039;m not stupid. I won&#039;t pay for something I don&#039;t need.

            <Content>To be quite honest, their stats look very good but in my experience the ones that may look good in the beginning are very bad in the end. I&#039;ve never used 000space; I currently use 000webhost and they are the best thing I have ever come across as far as free hosting goes.

I&#039;ve been coding and managing websites for 10 years so I know a good service when I see it, try out 000webhost and see what it can do for your endeavors.

P.S I am so glad that you put in your Additional Details that you are looking for FREE because I see so many of these questions and yet people still provide answers to things the asker wasn&#039;t even looking for.</Content>
