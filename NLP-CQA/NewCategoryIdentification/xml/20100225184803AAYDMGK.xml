  <Question id="20100225184803AAYDMGK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Sites where you can stream music for free (Not Last FM)?</Subject>
    <Content>Does anyone know any good sites where I can stream music for free? I&#039;ve tried Last FM, but I live in Canada, so I have to pay for it.

I&#039;m talking about sites like imeem (before it closed down) or myspace music. Any site where you can find an artist, pick a song and listen to it right on the browser.

            <Content>Try Pandora. You select a song or artist that you like and Pandora builds a list of songs that they estimate you&#039;ll also like. It&#039;s really cool and free.
