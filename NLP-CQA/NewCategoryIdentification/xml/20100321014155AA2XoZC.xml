    <Subject>How to download private torrents from multiple ips?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay, so its like this, when we download .torrent files from a private tracker, the downloaded .torrent file has some kinda code in it, that allowes us to download it, so if i downloaded it (the .torrent file) at my home, it wont work/let me download (the .torrent file) at my office, right? So i was wondering if we could somehow make it work, perhaps by editing the .torrent file or something....

    <ChosenAnswer>The .torrent file has a list of trackers and the file you&#039;re wanting to download, so, technically it&#039;s just a link.

You could download the .torrent file at home and then run them on your torrent program at work and it should work just fine.

Make sure you&#039;re using a program like PeerBlock to reduce your chances of getting in trouble.
