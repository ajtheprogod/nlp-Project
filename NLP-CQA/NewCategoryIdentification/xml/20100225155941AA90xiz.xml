  <Question id="20100225155941AA90xiz" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Has anyone ever been on chatroulette?</Subject>
    <Content>If you don&#039;t know what it is, its like a website where you can video chat with absolutely random strangers. Its kind of an interesting idea, but I&#039;m not sure...i&#039;m usually too freaked out to ever talk to anyone, especially since i am a girl whilst 90% are probably horny teenage guys and half of them are just jerking off on camera. 

Has anyone had any good experiences with the website? I&#039;ve heard some really crazy (good) stories about that site along with the countless bad ones, but what do you all think?

    <ChosenAnswer>kind of a goofy site. can be pretty hilarious though. i never go on alone though just incase i get some creep. it&#039;s fun to go on with a friend though and kind of just talk to random people. but once you get some creepy kid jacking off i usually just make a stupid comment.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I was curious the other day, and went on by myself.  Bad idea.
Many of people just &quot;next&quot; you for no reason.
A lot of people will ask you one question, you&#039;ll answer, you&#039;ll both sit their for like 15 seconds, and then it gets awkward and you&#039;ll next them.
About a quarter of the cams are just signs that say &quot;Boobs please.&quot;
Another quarter is guys jerking off.

So, it&#039;s probably more fun with at least one other friend - you can laugh at the crazy people rather than just being creeped out!</Content>
