    <ChosenAnswer>Lockerz is not a scam, and the &quot;coming soon&quot; will go away on 1 day of each month. The one day of each month is called Redemption day. Soon they will be 24/7, but, they will be multiplying the cost of each item by 4. Coming soon simply means that redemption is soon.</ChosenAnswer>
