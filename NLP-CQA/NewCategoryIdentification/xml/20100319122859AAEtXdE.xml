    <Subject>Question about a problem I am having with Firefox and formatting text.?</Subject>
    <Content>So, I am having this little problem with firefox. Everytime I am on Gaia online, and I have a long post typed up, I try and format it and it skips to the start of the post. For example, if I have a huge paragraph typed up, and I want something to be in bold, I will highlight it, put it in bold, and it will bring me to the start of what I wrote. This is a massive pain, because I often times decorate my posts for my roleplays.

I know it is not Gaia because it does not do this on any other browser, nor does it do this on my friend&#039;s firefox browser.

Please help!
yes, it is up to date

            <Content>Is your version of Firefox up-to-date (3.6.1)? If it isn&#039;t, please update it. That&#039;s the easiest way to fix problems.</Content>
