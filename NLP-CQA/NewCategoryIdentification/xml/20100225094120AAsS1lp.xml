  <Question id="20100225094120AAsS1lp" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Gifsoup won&#039;t let me download.?</Subject>
    <Content>When I click the &quot;download&quot; button, it just goes to a blank page.

Rightclick + save doesn&#039;t work; it will only save as a bitmap, not a gif.

What could be causing this problem, and is there any way to fix it? I use Windows Vista.  Any suggestions for alternative sites (that are free) are welcome...

    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;ve had the same problem. I did find out however if you have the firefox browser it will let you save the large gif on the main page, but it still won&#039;t let you use the &quot;download Gif&quot; button. You can download the firefox browser for free at http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ie.html   

I honestly perfer the firefox browser over Internet Explorer browser anyway. 
Hope this helped.</ChosenAnswer>
