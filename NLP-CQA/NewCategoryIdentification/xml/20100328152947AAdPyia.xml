  <Question id="20100328152947AAdPyia" type="Deleted">
    <Subject>I wanna earn some MAJOR Swag bucks (Swagbucks.com) Please Help!!!?</Subject>
    <Content>I started a blog (sorta), to get some referrals for Swag bucks, but there is absolutely NOTHING happening to me! Nothing, mainly because i&#039;m home schooled, which is great but i have almost no friends. I do have a few hobbies but i rarely do anything with those hobbies, nothing to write about anyway. What can i do with my blog to get more traffic for free? And get more Swag bucks referrals. Thanks in advance!
