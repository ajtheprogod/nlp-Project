    <ChosenAnswer>Most of the people on that site are either trolls, or exhibitionists (they get off on people watching them do &quot;private&quot; things).  It really is NOT a good place to meet people (well, NORMAL people).  You have a better chance using Facebook or MySpace.

I&#039;m sure Chatroulette is moderated, but most likely only for content that is actually illegal.  Guys jerking off over a webcam, unfortunately, is not a crime.  Unless it&#039;s being shown to minors.</ChosenAnswer>
