  <Question id="20100306125024AAkSDqZ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Have forums like this and social networking become just an excuse for mean/angry people to mistreat others?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m thinking if you know what I mean, I probably don&#039;t need to elaborate.
KL:  Am I supposed to take that as ironic?  I mean, was it meant to be humorous?

            <Content>Not really, it&#039;s done so much more than that.  But hiding behind anonymity certainly does bring to light, certain social aspects one wouldn&#039;t usually encounter in normal face to face conversations.</Content>
