    <Subject>Aim won&#039;t let me sign in?</Subject>
    <Content>I have been going on aim all day today, and this time when I tried to log on it kept saying incorrect username or password. I KNOW I typed my password in correctly, it&#039;s not on caps lock and the numbers aren&#039;t locked either. When I click on forgot my password the picture thingy with the letters and numbers combo won&#039;t show up. Did I get hacked by some like super genius, or is Aim just not working? Or is it something else? Help!!!1

    <ChosenAnswer>No, you didn&#039;t get hacked. Don&#039;t worry.
AIM is either editing the program or they&#039;re having some difficulties. It&#039;s not just you.
