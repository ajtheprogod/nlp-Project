  <Question id="20100313181320AALE2JG" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is this website called?</Subject>
    <Content>I saw a commercial for this skin care product, and basically you visit their website and you take an acne/skin test.  They say that they have over 40 products and they will match you their top 3 for your test results and you can buy the products and they&#039;re supposed to get rid of your acne and make your skin healthier.
It also told you some of the questions they ask and some of them are &quot;how sensitive is your skin?&quot; and &quot;how bad is your acne?&quot;

Does anyone know the website, plus what is the name of the product?

Thanks!
