  <Question id="20100228221941AApfdde" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Where can I find stock photos to include in articles?</Subject>
    <Content>I take part in article writing sometimes on the internet.   Very few of my articles contain pictures and I&#039;d like to change that.   Is there a place on the internet that has lots and lots of photos I can choose from to send to my desktop that I then can use to include in articles I write on the internet.  I&#039;d also like usage of the stock photo site to be free and easy to use.

            <Content>You can find good photos for writing articles and blogs in this website : http://www.istockphoto.com
They are very cheap photos that sell for as little as $1.00. 
Be careful and avoid infringing on people&#039;s patent rights when using images that you have not created or bought.</Content>
