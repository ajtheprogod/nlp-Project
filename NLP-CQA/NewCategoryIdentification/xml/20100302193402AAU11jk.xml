    <ChosenAnswer>I have found it really depends on the show with HULU. Most of the time it&#039;s anywhere from 2 to 3 days later. On rare occasions I have seen it released the following day.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>depends on the show.  Hulu has to buy the rights to show these shows, and each show has different contract requirements, a lot of them require they wait a week after the new episode airs, while others only a day.</Content>
