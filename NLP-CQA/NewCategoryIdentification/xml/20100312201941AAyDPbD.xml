  <Question id="20100312201941AAyDPbD" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is what they said true?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok, this is really bad. I was looking at pornography, and I clicked on a link that I thought was teenage porn. But then it says, &quot;Thanks for visting. Your address is being traced and agents will contact you shortly to convince you that you need to have better morals.&quot; and stuff like that, and I was wondering if agents will come and visit me? I know I sound like a creepy idiot, but I&#039;m really quite scared.
Please, no stupid answers.
Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>Awe poor you. I can imagine having that happen to me.
But no, there are millions of porn. sites out there, if they were illegal they wouldn&#039;t be up.

So if it&#039;s not illegal what reason would someone send agents out? Surely not to convince you of better morals.

No don&#039;t worry about it no one is going to visit you, in fact unless you&#039;ve committed a crime I do believe tracing computers to people&#039;s homes, is in it&#039;s self, illegal. Therefore the agents would get in trouble :P</ChosenAnswer>
