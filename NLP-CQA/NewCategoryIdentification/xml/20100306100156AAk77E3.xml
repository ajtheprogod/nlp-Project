    <Subject>Does anyone have an account on TalkBurst with lots of experience points?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay so people have made a profile for me on TalkBurst and some of the comments about me are censored. Does anyone have an account with experience points that they can use to reveal the comments? I really want to know what is written about me.
