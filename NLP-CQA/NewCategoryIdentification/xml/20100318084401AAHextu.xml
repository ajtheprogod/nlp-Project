  <Question id="20100318084401AAHextu" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I Found A Website That Shows Real Death, Shouldnt It Be Illegal?</Subject>
    <Content>Im not gonna post the link but it is very very brutal, and Im 17 with strong stomach for this type of thing, I accidentally stumbled across it one day.

Shouldnt it be wrong, and the members of the site are all cheering for it, just sad, how can I try to do something (Iv seen beheadings, hangings of gays, car accidents, dismemberment, cannibalism) all of which were REAL videos
OK but surely its wrong morally, to show innocent people things like that, I clicked and clicked and now I cant get these sick images out of my head

        <Answer>
            <Content>Why should that be illegal?  It&#039;s grotesque to be sure, but people die all the time.  It&#039;s not illegal to watch someone die... just in bad taste.</Content>

            <Content>It&#039;s not illegal unless it&#039;s copyrighted. That kind of stuff is interesting to many of people. Most of those sites give warning about the gore.</Content>
