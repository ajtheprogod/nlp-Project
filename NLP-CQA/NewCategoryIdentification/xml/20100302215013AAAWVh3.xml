    <ChosenAnswer>No way to turn it off.  Amazon does big business within the marketplace - and it&#039;s not like ebay - you aren&#039;t bidding on stuff, you are just buying them from private sellers.  Just make sure that when you go to purchase something that the seller is Amazon.com.  Not hard to do at all.</ChosenAnswer>
