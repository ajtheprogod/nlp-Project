            <Content>Try this : 

https://www.palmbux.com/register.php?r=vickai

The strategy in palmbux is to rent a lot of referrals. You get paid 0.8 cents per ad, each rented referral is 30 cents for 1 month, 10 cents per recycle. The strategy is to keep renting referrals who have a good clicks/day. With a lot of good referrals you can earn a lot! Think of renting referrals as an investment. Its 1 cents/day. If they click 4 ads per day, its definitely more than the 1 cent/day you paid. Later when you max out your standard rented referrals(1500) you can definitely earn more than $10 or more per day =). Patience is key. Remember to keep recycling inactive rented referrals.

Also try the following if you like:

            <Content>I&#039;ve always been interested in this, well more so intrigued, but it seems that it is really ridiculously difficult to find something that&#039;s actually real. I just recently did some searching and found a site that seems somewhat legitimate. http://www.clixsense.com/?3129529 It doesn&#039;t seem too overly flashy and shady.</Content>
