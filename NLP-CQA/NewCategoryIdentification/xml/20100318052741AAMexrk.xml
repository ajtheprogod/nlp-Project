    <ChosenAnswer>Yes, you need to click on contact seller, tell him you want to return item for a refund, explaining why.

If you don`t get satisfaction, you need to click on &quot;more actions&quot;  &quot;resolve a problem&quot;  just under feedback.

Was the item cheap? you usually get just what you pay for. 

How was the item described?

Did you look at sellers feedback to see if anyone else has complained about counterfeit items?</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Are you 100% certain?
I knew somebody lost $700 on the same of a genuine Dolce and Gabbana men&#039;s jacket because the buyer claimed it was a fake and put in a PayPal claim.
Despite an actual Dolce and Gabanna store ponouncing the item 100% genuine, the buyer simply refused to acknowledge that he was wrong making the ridiculous assertion that the Dolce and Gabbana management were wrong (simply to hang on to his refund).</Content>
