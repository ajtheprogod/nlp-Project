    <Subject>How to know when someone has erased me from their Skype Contacts?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a male friend who we used to chat through Skype. At first I used to see his icon shown everytime I connected to Facebook or in the internet even as disconnected, now i don&#039;t see his icon anymore. I try and see other contacts as well and I can see theirs.....is it that he erased me without telling me?  How should I know?
And if he&#039;s always invisble?
