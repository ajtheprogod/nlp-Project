    <ChosenAnswer>A beta reader is basically an editor.  I&#039;ve never had a beta reader, but I don&#039;t update enough, and my grammar is fairly good.  I have a beta profile on FFN&#039;s sister website, fictionpress.com (under the name Bagoosa, in case you were wondering).  I got a PM asking me to beta a  story, but I haven&#039;t heard back.  I think all you have to do is find the beta you want and send them an e-mail about it.  If there&#039;s something else, and experienced beta should be able to guide you from there.

I hope that helps!</ChosenAnswer>
