            <Content>It all depends on what you like best. Internet Explorer will most likely have the least issues because it was designed specifically for Windows, and is also the safest in terms of malware. Firefox has a memory issue that some users expeirience that can easily freeze a computer, and so far there is no officially supported fix. Chrome is still in its early stage which means all the bugs are still being worked out. I myself would recommend Internet Explorer 8 or Opera 10.51.</Content>
