    <ChosenAnswer>Safari or Chrome.

The WebKit core. Which one you choose is basically personal preference, as they&#039;ll keep taking from one another and getting faster at the same rate.

The Opera guys are tough, and they&#039;re good at making things fast, but there&#039;s really no marketshare. In four years, Chrome will supplant Internet Explorer as the most used browser, so I&#039;d stick with a WebKit base (either Safari or Chrome) to ensure compatibility with emerging web standards.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Why is Firefox not on the list? For me, Firefox is the best. I&#039;ve been using it since first version and I&#039;ve seen how powerful it become. Try to see it yourself. It may not be the fastest but the most reliable and trusted to me. Just my opinion.</Content>

            <Content>Firefox is the best browser, it&#039;s got tons of addons that add loads to the functionality to the browser.
Chrome crashes a lot (my experience!)
Opera is good too, you can give it a try too.
Safari too crashed a few times while i used it.</Content>
