            <Content>I tried a couple of times on those sites and all they want is your personal info so they can sell you other things. When you click on you have to take some sort of survey &amp;if you answer yes to any question it goes to another site and before you know it the original reason you went there is totally lost in the shuffle. It is all too time consuming &amp; as we know &quot;nothing is for free anyway&quot;. MO</Content>
