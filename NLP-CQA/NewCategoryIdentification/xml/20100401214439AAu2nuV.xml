    <ChosenAnswer>yeah you can easily trace people who are logged into your pc

goto start - run - cmd - type netstat -a

this will show list of ip address and ports who are connect with your pc... so if you find some illegal actions just report to cyber crime or watever...

If you wanna learn more abt these stuffs like hacking and Breaking firewalls and so on check
