  <Question id="20100222124208AAKsHaM" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What&#039;s the best way to stylize a ComicPress installation for my webcomic?</Subject>
    <Content>I am attempting to revolutionize the Internet (with a revolutionary new webcomic) and have stumbled into a most unfortunate barrier. Apparently &quot;ComicPress&quot; is not so plug-and-play, user-friendly, easy-to-use as it is advertised to be.

Upon installing ComicPress (an arduous task I shan&#039;t bore you with the details of) I have discovered that I lack the knowledge to customize it beyond the predetermined themes. Perhaps I have missed the option available for such a task. Regardless, I require help, and have come to Yahoo! Answers in hopes of receiving at least some insight into this conundrum of coding.

I think I should be able to style a ComicPress install without having to learn an entirely new language. That&#039;s ridiculous. Millions of people have websites, and I doubt all of them are expert programmers.

    <ChosenAnswer>Try ComicPress 2.5 it&#039;s the Windows XP of the ComicPress versions with everything after being the Vista versions of ComicPress.  They&#039;re supposedly coming out with a ComicPress 3.0 which the webcomic community is hoping will be the Windows 7 version of ComicPress.

ComicPress 2.5 is fairly easy to customize with lots of tutorials online and documentation IN the files.  I don&#039;t know of anyone who&#039;s had an easy time adapting the newer versions of ComicPress.</ChosenAnswer>
