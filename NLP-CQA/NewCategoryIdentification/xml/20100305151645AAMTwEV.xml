    <Subject>How to start an ebay account?</Subject>
    <Content>OK, so I have this guitar that was given to me, and I&#039;m desperately low on cash... I have no idea what ebay is like, or what to expect when signing up... I don&#039;t want to try it until I know what I&#039;m dealing with... so can I please have some human help?

            <Content>Make an ebay account.
Take a picture of your guitar.
Also what type of guitar is it cause it&#039;s a genuine les paul etc sell it for a high price [:
Go to &#039;Sell&#039; on options once your ebay account is made.
Upload pictures, have a description. What colour, make, etc
Have a minimum bid on it.
Whatever you&#039;d feel comfortable selling for.
Hope it all works out {:</Content>
