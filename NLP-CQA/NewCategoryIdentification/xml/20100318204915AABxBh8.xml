    <Subject>What&#039;s the protocol in eBay for an item to be shipped after you won and paid for it?</Subject>
    <Content>I recently won an item on eBay. And paid for it within the hour. I was wondering if there is any protocol that dictates that a seller must ship an item within certain hours/days of payment.

    <ChosenAnswer>The deal is between you and the seller. eBay doesn&#039;t step in unless you file a complaint.  For example you bought something, waited for a reasonable amount of time, your item never arrived and you couldn&#039;t make contact with the seller.  eBay assumes a potential buyer will check the sellers feedback before they place a bid.  So if your asking if eBay requires a seller to ship within a specified time frame,  the answer is no.</ChosenAnswer>
