  <Question id="20100326233751AAi4C6y" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Which eBay seller(s) consistantly has the best penny auctions with free ship?</Subject>
    <Content>I love getting stuff for free... and paying only a penny for something is almost like getting it for free!  

On eBay, I have no trouble finding a black pouch for a mp3 player, or a single bead to fit a pandora bracelet, but it seems to be quite time consuming to find any auctions that I can actually win with a $0.01 bid and get free shipping.

Does anyone know of any sellers that frequently has auctions that can be won with only a one-cent bid with free shipping?  Or of any good search tips so I can find them easily?

    <ChosenAnswer>How would somebody consistently stay in business and why would they continue to do that if it costs 40 something cents just to mail a postcard or letter? That means they lose 30 something cents each time, not to mention ebay fees.</ChosenAnswer>
