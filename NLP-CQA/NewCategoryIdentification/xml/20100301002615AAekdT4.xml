    <Subject>TUMBLR question! Reblogging / code query?</Subject>
    <Content>When someone reblogs my post, nothing happens on my own tumblr to show this. Something does show on other people&#039;s tumblrs, though. How can I change this on mine? Sorry if this was a bit confusing :P

Is it a code of some sort?
Thank you VERY much for any help :)
oh wow, you&#039;re right! it took like, 24 hours but it shows up. thanks so much!! :D

    <ChosenAnswer>Maybe your tumblr is running a little bit slow. Try refreshing. If you&#039;re a long time tumblr user then you&#039;ll know tumblr ALWAYS has problems :)</ChosenAnswer>
