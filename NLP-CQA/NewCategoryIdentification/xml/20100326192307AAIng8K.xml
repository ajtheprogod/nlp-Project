Did you accidently click &quot;Confirm your purchase&quot; on the next page too? I can understand hitting the BIN by mistake, but not confirming the purchase on the next page.

&quot;I just bought it.&quot;

Umm, no you didn&#039;t, as you haven&#039;t paid for it

And yes, it is your fault. The seller didn&#039;t hit the BIN you did.

You have a few options here:

Pay the seller and resell the phone yourself.

Wait for the sellers response and beg him to cancel the transaction.

Or offer to pay him the fees he incurred due to your &quot;mistake&quot;</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I haven&#039;t bought anything on eBay for years, but if it&#039;s still the same, then there&#039;s nothing to worry about if no money has changed hands. If you explained in your emails to the seller that you hit the &quot;Buy it Now&quot; button by accident, they may have just re-listed it and are too annoyed to respond. 

My understanding is that eBay has turned into a huge shopping website, not the auction website it was originally intended to be. Chances are that they seller has dozens of what he is selling, so don&#039;t worry that you&#039;ve taken it &quot;off the market&quot;. If the seller was that interested in selling it, he&#039;d have contacted you back by now.</Content>
