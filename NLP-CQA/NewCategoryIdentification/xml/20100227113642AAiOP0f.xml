    <ChosenAnswer>there were many bugs in the systems earlier. now they are fixed. so this type of access is not possible. you can use t-shark if your phone supports it. for a gprs keep your balance lower than the daily fee. sometimes you succeed in this and dont have to pay further for many days. i have done these tricks 2 years back. may be they might not work now. and there is no illegal in it. its the operator&#039;s fault. dont try hack tricks. they may track you and put you in jail.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Buddy... GPRS costs anything from being &#039;Free to Rs 50&#039; in rental and you are only charged for the data you download, at very cheap rates... Also for all practical purposes, GPRS is a very slow way to access the WAP pages only on dumb phones/pseudo-smart phones.

            <Content>Internet on GPRS is something you need to pay for.
If you try to access it for free without paying the internet service provider, you are indulging in a crime.
If they press charges and prosecute you and send you jail. you will have no future left, no passport, no visa, no job prospects for a jail bird.
It certainly is not recommended. Think.</Content>
