    <ChosenAnswer>I bought a mobile phone on ebay. Compared to in store prices for the same phone I saved upwards of 75 bucks! Do your research before you commit to buy. Make sure it&#039;s the lowest price for that phone and make sure it&#039;s the same company as your contract. If you don&#039;t have a contract yet, pick the best phone plan and go with that company. I don&#039;t know if you have bell in the states. But avoid bell! I hate my phone company.</ChosenAnswer>
