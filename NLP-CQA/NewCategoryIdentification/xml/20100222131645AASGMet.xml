    <ChosenAnswer>All I can say is contact the Police and or a Lawyer....It will most likely take legal action or it may even be a criminal offense...

Other than that, there isn&#039;t much you can do as it is being &quot;Hosted&quot; on your ex&#039;s computer and Limewire is only acting as the &quot;middle man&quot;...They are the ones telling where it is at and then those who download it are getting it straight from your ex&#039;s computer (or any other folks who have already downloaded it and have it in an open folder that Limewire is allowed to put on their list of files for download).</ChosenAnswer>
