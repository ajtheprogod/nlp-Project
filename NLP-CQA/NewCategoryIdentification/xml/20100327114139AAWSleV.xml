    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s because you are still on Level 1. When you reach Level 2 that will change and you have another 61 points to go!

It was done to stop active spam links being put up, as most spammers don&#039;t get past Level 1 because their accounts are always being terminated.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You need to be Level 2 (250 points). Keep answering questions and don&#039;t ask too many questions and soon you&#039;ll be able to post proper links.</Content>

            <Content>it happens to me aswell, cant explain it. 

but think it&#039;s somethink Yahoo have put in, because of all the spam and links to viruses that have been appearing, they&#039;ve disabled the hyperlinks, but not fully. (as i can get them in a preview or when answering a question, but not on the actual question or answer page)

when putting in a hyperlink (the blue clickable link) it should start with http:// and end with the correct ending, which you are doing since you get the blue link.</Content>
