    <ChosenAnswer>That&#039;s a great idea, especially if it&#039;s the actual fruit of your labor that employers are really looking for like a painting or model or something. I don&#039;t think I would send it to them without warning, though, but that&#039;s just my opinion (they might just delete it if it has attachments they don&#039;t know about). On your job application, resume, or just in an email to them, you could add a note that your work/portfolio is available to be sent to them at their request in the form of photos, a Powerpoint, etc. This way they should be looking forward to receiving examples of your work. Good luck, anyway!</ChosenAnswer>
