  <Question id="20100303112702AAj27bp" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is a good website to use to locate someone and has accurate info?</Subject>
    <Content>I am helping a friend locate their spouse to have divorce docs served.  The person thinks that if the documents can&#039;t be served, there&#039;s no way to get a divorce.

I&#039;m not asking for hostile reasons.  I am willing to pay for services, but there are just so many out there!

Have you ever used a site like this sucessfully?  What site was it or what was it called?

    <ChosenAnswer>Serving the divorce docs is not necessary in all cases, but maybe he needs it for closure or something.
