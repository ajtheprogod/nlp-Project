    <Subject>&#039;public&#039; wifi connection with utorrent?</Subject>
    <Content>I share a wifi connection with my landlord and utorrent hasn&#039;t worked since I started using it. I&#039;m assuming its because of that, though I&#039;m really not sure. I get a decent enough connection to the internet and my utorrent is up to date. Any suggestions on getting it to download my queue?
