    <Subject>Will a proxy server keep me from getting caught downloading torrents?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m trying to find a way to download bitorrent&#039;s without getting caught by my internet provider (i&#039;ve already gotten a pre-lawsuit notice, so i know they are watching me extra close.) will a proxy server hide me completely? or can my internet provider still see what i&#039;m downloading?

            <Content>Everything you do goes through your ISP, and that is where you are being tracked from.  It seems to me you don&#039;t give a damn about the law, so go right ahead and steal! We&#039;ll see you when you  get out of prison!</Content>

            <Content>Sorta, but no... It will redirect your outside ip address, but if someone was looking for you, and they did what is called a traceroute it would show your actual outside ip address as one of the hops it takes... so no not really :(</Content>
