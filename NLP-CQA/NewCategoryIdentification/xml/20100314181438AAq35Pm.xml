    <ChosenAnswer>Ahhh the complicated nature of Faunasphere genetics.   Each egg has two different sets of genes, one is dominant the other is recessive.   The dominate genes will more often than not decide the species of the new Fauna.  There is also the possibility of a mutation, this can happen at any time.  You can influence the outcome of the genetics but you cannot control it.

Your best change is to find a Fauna with a dominate gene that you want, and cross it with another Fauna of that type.  This can take time to achieve however!</ChosenAnswer>
