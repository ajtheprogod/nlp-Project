    <ChosenAnswer>Efficacy of the product aside, the site does not have a good reputation with Web of Trust:

McAfee&#039;s SiteAdvisor gives it a (dubious, in my opinion) green light.  See the reviewer comments on both sites.

            <Content>All of them are a scam.. there&#039;s no proof that product does anything.

            <Content>Don&#039;t sign up for anything that will capture your credit card details, i&#039;ve been scammed before and I lost a lot of money! I still take Acai berry though but only from a reliable and trusted company called www.acaiberryslim.co.uk. No chargebacks, no signing over your life and the capsules are stronger than anyone else. Give them a try, call them and they will send you a free trial bottle. Acai will work for you but its vital that you have a balanced diet also.</Content>
