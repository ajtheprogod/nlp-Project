    <Subject>Does anyone know how to cancel a bid on E-bay?</Subject>
    <Content>I put in a bid for a “Mickey Mouse Outfit”, and now it seems I&#039;m only six minutes away from owning Obama and his cabinet....
This was a JOKE. 
Heavy sigh.

1. Go to the specific listing and at the top of the listing...click to the right of  &quot;bid history&quot;...the &quot;# bid(s)&quot; icon.(example &quot;3 bids&quot;). This will take you to the bid history page.
2. At the bottom of the bid history table is a &quot;cancel bids&quot; icon...click over it.  You will reach eBay&#039;s help pages, titled Managing bidders and buyers
3. The rest is easy.  Under the Managing bidders and buyers title are a list of topics...click &quot;Canceling bids&quot;.  This will take you to the &quot;Canceling bids&quot; section.
4. Click over the &quot;Canceling bids placed on your listing&quot; icon (#1 in the yellow box).  This will take you to the bid cancellation page!  Whew!
