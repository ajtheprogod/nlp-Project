  <Question id="20100315152929AA2LDhr" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Firefox V.S. Seamonkey (and others)?</Subject>
    <Content>Due to this post here I am now afraid of google, and also in turn I do not like firefox because they are funded by them:

So what I want to know is, since Seamonkey doesn&#039;t have the google search bar, is it safe? and if now what is? (I don&#039;t like Internet explorer, it has the bar as well)

    <ChosenAnswer>I have been using SeaMonkey since version 1.1.10 Still loving every minute on version 2.0.3

Its a great stable browser that has a hell of a lot going for it.
The browser is simple and not overcrowded with junk
Built in Email client just as powerful as Thunderbird
HTML editor easily bash up a site in no time, Don&#039;t expect Dreamweaver standards but more then competent for simple sites
Address book (never used it)
and ChatZilla another quality client bundled in

I simply cannot fathom how sheep continue to ignore the superior (IMO) functionality of SeaMonkey and continue with Firefox that I dropped like a hot potato on release of v3.

Pretty much everything I do online is now in 1 program and not 3.. Makes sense to me.</ChosenAnswer>
