    <ChosenAnswer>Not all sellers send emails to let you know its been shipped. Is the box icon next to the dvds lit up? this indicates the item has been posted to (not all sellers use that function either) What is the sellers handling time?
I wouldnt worry about it yet,  if you dont receive it in 2 or so weeks open a item not received dispute.</ChosenAnswer>
