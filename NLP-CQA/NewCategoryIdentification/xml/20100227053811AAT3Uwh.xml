    <Subject>Ebay Question (Post office)?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve made an account with eBay a few months ago and yesterday i managed to get a ps3 pretty cheap, the delivery was 1st class standard.
What happens if the parcel is undelivered/Lost? 

I bought a Nintendo 64 a while ago for around a fiver but it never came, i didn&#039;t bother chasing after it since it was so cheap. I don&#039;t want the same to happen with this. 
The seller didn&#039;t offer an insurance or anything. Will PayPal hold the funds until i receive the ps3? If it was lost would i get my money back? 

I&#039;m really eager to start playing :P I&#039;ve already got modern warfare 2 and AVP 
Any advice is welcomed ^_^

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi there! I am assuming that the lost parcel was sent through the post office. If so this is a very rare occurrence. Any parcel that is being mailed through the Post Office can be insured for a very nominal fee if you choose this.. However, through personal experience, i think it is a waste of money. I use only the Post Office to send my E-bay parcels and have never had a problem with anything getting lost in 8yrs. The only time that I will use FedEx or UPS is if it is requested by the buyer. I hate doing that though, because I have to increase my shipping fee. Anyhow, I hope that this has been helpful in some small way. Best of luck to you!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Give your Seller a chance to at least get it in the post (however the seller is silly he should send Special Delivery- but that;s his problem)
If he sends Mon you should get around Tues/ Wed; but dont need to be hasty you have up to 45 days to claim if it is lost or not as described /broken etc..
Paypal will refund you without a doubt

BTW paypal may hold HIS funds for 21 days, he is still supposed to send and await your feedback</Content>
