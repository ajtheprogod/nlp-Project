    <ChosenAnswer>I would use Frostwire, it&#039;s open source and you will get &quot;Turbo speed&quot; downloads.

If you know how to use Torrents, this is by far, the better option: I would use uTorrent as my downloader/ Seeder - utorrent.com and use Torrentz.com for your files, then use ThePirateBay.org Torrent Trackers &amp;/or the Mininova.org, their your safest options.</ChosenAnswer>
