  <Question id="20100311150010AARkBCv" type="Answered">
    <Subject>how do you remove a website you have made from the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>I maintain the website at my school, and recently the school got a new website. The problem is that now the school has two websites with the same address. What I want to do is remove the old one so that it stops showing up when people look for the school website.
I know that I shouldn&#039;t be able to have two different sites with the same address, but I do. That&#039;s my problem. When I type in the address on different computers or at different times, sometimes the old website appears and sometimes the new one appears. I want to know how to disable or delete the old website from the host computer.

    <ChosenAnswer>You can&#039;t have 2 websites with the same address. 

Sitename.com only points to one location. If the problem is that you have an old site and want to point that old site to the new one then place a redirect code into the old sites index.html  file to redirect the person to the new site name.

If you have 2 index files in the site one called index.php and the other index.html then erase the old one and the new one will take over.</ChosenAnswer>
