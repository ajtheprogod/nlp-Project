    <ChosenAnswer>Because some other bidder outbid them first. Bidders can enter a maximum amount they will bid, and when they are outbid by someone else, it automatically ups their current bid, up to the maximum amount. It does appear like they are outbidding themselves, but that&#039;s what&#039;s happening. If you really want some entertainment, wait until the last five minutes or so in the auction, and keep refreshing the page every thirty seconds.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>They don&#039;t. You can set a maximum bid early on when you place your first bid on an item, say you are prepared to bid a maximum of 30 dollars but the starting bid is 6 dollars so that is your first bid. If that is they only bid you win the item for 6 dollars. 

If someone else does bid then everytime they bid more money Ebay bids automatically on your behalf so the name of the winning bidder changes and it might seem that they are bidding against themselves but this is not the case. 

If you are the highest bidder at say 25 dollars then that is all you pay even if your maximum bid was 30 dollars. You don&#039;t have to pay your maximum bid if nobody else bids that high, it just depends what other people bid and how high the auction goes.</Content>
