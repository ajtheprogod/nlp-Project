    <Subject>Getting a wireless internet card?</Subject>
    <Content>Hello, I live in a very rural area, and I am interested in getting a wireless internet card that I can just hook into my computer without worrying about reception. How do these work? Can I get them by themselves or do I have to also buy a phone, etc.? I&#039;ve looked at Sprint and AT&amp;T and it looks like they want you to get it with a phone, as well. Is this just a gimmick to try and sell phones? I will be needing another phone company, anyway, so should I get them together? What company do you suggest?

Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>You do not technically need a phone, but they may require you to get one.  Though if you push they may relent and just let you buy the card.

From what i&#039;ve heard verizon is the best for that kind of thing, followed by at&amp;t.  I&#039;ve been told (by a best buy mobile employee) that sprints data network is terrible.</ChosenAnswer>
