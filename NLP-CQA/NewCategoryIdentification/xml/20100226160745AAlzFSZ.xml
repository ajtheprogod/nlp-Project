    <ChosenAnswer>Hi,

Don&#039;t go for free web hosting.They are not reliable..

I would recommend &quot;Web Hosting Pad&quot; for your Web Hosting because it&#039;s cheap and very reliable.With web hosting, you&#039;ll get free domain. Their support service is awesome. This company offers site building tools, application vault, web mail, antivirus, Php, MysQL ,e-commerce and hosts unlimited websites in one plan.
