    <Subject>HELP ROUTER, INTERNET, VERIZON!!!!!?</Subject>
    <Content>Hello I have  a problem with my internet connection and i am completely lost. I have two desktop and my father&#039;s desktop is connected to the Verizon Internet, and the router( idk if its that) the one that connect with the phone cable. So its downstair, i live on the second floor and i am currently using Netgear wireless-G Usb 2.0 adapter. But i am not sure why but the internet on the second floor is a lot slower(maybe because wireless) but sometimes its very slow. Is there anyway to make the internet connection on the second floor faster? Can you tell me if i  should buy a better wireless router ? If i do can you please tell me which type i should buy? Thanks for your time for reading my problem and have a great day..
I dont mind buying the cable but i live on the second floor so the ethernet cable wouldn&#039;t reach there unless i drill holes in my house. and i cant put the modem thingy in my room because there is no phone line that s connecting to my room. is there anythning i can buy to make my internet faster? should i buy a wireless router? is the wireless router same as my netgear usb adapter? thanks for the answer and hv a great day!
