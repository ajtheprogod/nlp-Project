    <ChosenAnswer>It means that the security certificate for the gmail website is invalid. Check the date and time settings on your PC to make sure they&#039;re right. If that&#039;s OK, then it&#039;s very possible that you have a nasty virus or something similar. Make sure your antivirus and anti-malware tools are up to date and do a scan.

DO NOT log in to gmail if you&#039;re getting errors about the security certificate! It could mean that somebody is able to steal your username and password.</ChosenAnswer>
