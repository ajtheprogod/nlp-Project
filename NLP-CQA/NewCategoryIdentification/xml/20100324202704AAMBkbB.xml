    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;ve actually tried bigspot and that was just a major waste of my time, I was making less than chump change with them. If you are 18 or older then I would recommend Opinionoutpost. It is a website that pays you roughly $8.00 per hour to take surveys. This isn&#039;t bad considering you can listen to music while taking surveys. It is 100% free to join as well as 100% confidential. Opinionoutpost will send you usually 2-3 surveys a day roughly $2.50 pay out each (and 15 to 20 minutes of work). I&#039;ve been taking surveys on the internet for over a year and can tell you that this is the highest paid survey site (of over 20 I&#039;ve tried) that I&#039;ve ever come across. It by no means will get you rich but it is some excellent side cash. Best of luck.
