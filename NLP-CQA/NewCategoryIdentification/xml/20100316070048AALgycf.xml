    <ChosenAnswer>Verizon has a FIOS network that is BLAZING. It costs a fortune, but you can get 50Mbs download speeds and 20Mbs upload. For $140/month.

Compare it to AT&amp;T&#039;s DSL Service (which is by no means slow). It costs $45/month and has 6Mbs download speed and 768Kbs.

The average broadband-connected household has 3Mbs download speed.

FIOS is FAST.

            <Content>At present Telstra hold much of the speed bandwidth in majority of states in Australia. While Telstra own the cabling and rights depending on the region you reside, the fastest you can go is ADSL 1 with most ISPs.
