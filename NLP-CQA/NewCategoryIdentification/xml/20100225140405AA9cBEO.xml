    <ChosenAnswer>Have you contacted the seller to enquire when it was posted? Do that first.
If they dont reply or give a unsaitsfactory answer start a item not received dispute through ebay. 
I understand you paid with a debit but was the transaction made through paypal? If so, start a dispute with paypal too If not contact your bank.</ChosenAnswer>
