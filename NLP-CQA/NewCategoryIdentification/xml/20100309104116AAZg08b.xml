    <Subject>Waldo MLIA help!!!!!!!?</Subject>
    <Content>Today, I read this MLIA:
Today, after reading the MLIA about sticking Waldo in the fifth Harry Potter book, I dashed to my school&#039;s library just in case he was there. The woman at the counter told me the book was checked out and I was sad- until I turned to see a senior boy angrily shaking the book muttering, &quot;Where&#039;s Waldo?&quot; MLIA. 

What was the MLIA about sticking Waldo in the 5th Harry Potter book? (I&#039;m gonna try and find him :P)

    <ChosenAnswer>I think it&#039;s about this one:
 
Today, I got bored in class and drew a very detailed picture of waldo. I spent a long time trying to figure out where I could put my waldo so someone cool would find it, so eventually, I decided to go to the library and hide it in the fifth harry potter book. MLIA 

That&#039;s probably why that senior is shaking that book. Otherwise I don&#039;t have a clue what they mean.</ChosenAnswer>
