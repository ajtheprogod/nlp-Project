    <Subject>How to get my internet back?!?!?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok. so I was playing on my computer and I exit off Internet for about, 10 minutes. Then, my internet wouldn&#039;t display web page. This was  happening for about a year, and then my mom helped me and we got a new router and it doesn&#039;t snap in, so we taped it on with tape. Now, the optimum homepage shows up, but if I press a link it says it cannot display web page again! Please can someone help me! I need to go on my computer! I&#039;m desperate! [by the way, it&#039;s a dell desktop and it&#039;s not wireless, it&#039;s connected to a computer upstairs, and the computer upstairs, shares a wire with two computers downstairs. The computer upstairs works and so does the other one downstairs, but not mine!] I&#039;m using the computer upstairs! (I just wan&#039;t the one in my room to work so I can use it whenever withought getting kicked off by my sister!) Please help me! thank you!
