  <Question id="20100319062713AAGqQRZ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I&#039;ve been using Google Chrome- Does it have a stop button?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m using Google Chrome, cause Firefox 3.6 has too many issues and WHO KNOWS when they&#039;re gonna get around to fixing them ??
Anyway I&#039;ve got the hang of the basics and have installed some add ons.
Is there a Stop button for GC ???
I can&#039;t believe that they didn&#039;t put it on as a standard part of their browser........
BTW: IE sucks (just like most Microsoft products) so don&#039;t say to use it. got out of that habit long ago.

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi,
Yes, off coarse there is.
It appears to the right of the address bar only when you are in the process of loading a page.

And yes, I agree. Firefox is a mess and IE is a holiday resort for hackers.
Google Chrome owns! :)

Good luck.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Just use Internet Explorer.  It&#039;s the best browser if you&#039;re on a Windows PC because it&#039;s built for Windows.  All of the other browsers aren&#039;t built for Windows specifically so they always have problems, whereas IE is always fixing and making their browser just that much better! :)</Content>
