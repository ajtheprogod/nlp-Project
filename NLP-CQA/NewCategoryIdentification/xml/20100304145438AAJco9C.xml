            <Content>First of all, to be clear, a hacker does not have to be a person with bad intentions, but is often a person who finds security breaches to improve something, like a website or a computer program.

You may want to check out hackthissite.org, though, a site where the goal is to finally hack that site.

But hacking is not easy, and you shouldn&#039;t do it in any illegal or bad way.</Content>

            <Content>Be curious. You&#039;re off to a good start.

Take things apart because you&#039;re curious about how they work - not just because I said to. Soon it&#039;ll be a burning curiosity every time you get something new, to take it apart and see how and why it works. Then you&#039;ll start fixing things, because you know how they _should_ work. Then you&#039;ll start modifying things, because you want it to do something you know it can, but doesn&#039;t. Then, my friend, you will be a hacker.

Or maybe you mean &quot;cracker&quot;. In which case, you can go become an hero.</Content>
