    <Subject>Where can you get free books online WITHOUT downloading?</Subject>
    <Content>Is there a site that doesn&#039;t give you any viruses or crash your computer that you can get free books online and if possible without downloading? If there is no other choice but to download how will it affect my computer? And if I go to the library, are all the popular books gone?

    <ChosenAnswer>Google Books is the most famous one. Although it restricts you from browsing all of a book&#039;s pages. 

But if you have had any purchase on Amazon.com. Then you can go to your desired book&#039;s page, then under the book picture, you may see &quot;Search inside this book&quot; link. This feature is available for many books on this site. Now, log in to your account and click that link. It shows you the book in the real printed book format.but this sometimes restricts you too.

Otherwise if you decide to download your favorite books from ebook sites. Then you can try these two ones:

ebookee.com
avaxhome.ru

I have tried them many times and never received a virus or something else.
