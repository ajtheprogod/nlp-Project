    <ChosenAnswer>Different fonts have different character sets. In Windows you can use the Character Map applet to browse the available selection (Start --&gt; Run --&gt; &quot;charmap&quot;). Fonts such as Wingdings, Webdings, Dingbats, and Symbol have a wide variety of novelty characters. For non-western characters you may have to download or buy special language-specific fonts.</ChosenAnswer>
