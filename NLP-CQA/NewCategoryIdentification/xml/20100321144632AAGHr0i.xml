  <Question id="20100321144632AAGHr0i" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Return Policy on Amazon UK?</Subject>
    <Content>I got the product wrapped in bubble wrap in an envelope and I want to return it (it has corrupt data) but the Amazon return policy says that it must be returned in the packaging it came in. Of course, I threw recycled the envelope and threw away the bubble wrap as I thought they were rubbish. Will I have to sift through my rubbish to re-wrap it in the bubble wrap/envelope it came in?

Thanks â˜º
