    <ChosenAnswer>Your D-Link router actually has a place in its configuration GUI where you can make a complete backup of the system including your port forwarding information.

You don&#039;t state which model of D-Link router you have, so I can&#039;t point you to the specific page on the router config site.  If you scout around on the D-Link&#039;s web configuration pages you should be able to find the Backup link which will create a file on your local desktop that contains all of your custom settings.

If your D-Link should ever crash, you simply reset it to defaults (or buy a new D-Link router if the unit fails entirely) and then restore your settings from the backup file.

Once restored, all your custom settings should be back in place and in effect.</ChosenAnswer>
