            <Content>If the computer that you are purchasing was made in the last five years it will have a &quot;wireless adaptor&quot;. This is a device that is inside of the machine and allows it to connect to the internet via wireless connections. The only thing you would have to do is go somewhere that is a wireless &quot;hotspot&quot;....such as Starbucks, airports, hotel lobbies ect.</Content>

            <Content>You will have to find a HOTSPOT where Wifi Access is provided.

Places like Cafe&#039;s Hotels. Airports and some Rail stations all provide access. Some is free and some you have to pay.</Content>

            <Content>You can buy a wifi router, but you would only get wireless internet in that house or area. Or you can buy a 3G stick for T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Sprint, or Verizon. It is a USB stick, so you plug it into your computer and you will get internet anywhere, ex: car, train, plane, park, anywhere. The first option is free. The second option costs approximately $60 a month.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>As others have mentioned, you could use WiFi to connect to a wireless network for Internet access. WiFi is free.

If you wanted to have Internet access anywhere, however, you would have to subscribe to a 3G/4G provider, which is a service you must pay a monthly fee for.</Content>
