  <Question id="20100227021525AA6k01E" type="Answered">
    <Subject>HELP!  I dont know how i can do this!!!?</Subject>
    <Content>I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND HOW I CAN DO IT!!  The rule states that it cannot be done, but i always strive to achieve the impossible.  I try, and try, and try some more, but i never can seem to get it done.  No matter where i turn, people are dashing my dreams to pieces, with 5 simple words.  WHY CANT I DO IT?!  I never listened to rules before, and i dont want to now!  ALL I WANT is to do this one thing in my life...but im told i cannot because some dude decided to make the rule that i cannot do it.  \

I&#039;m told time and time again, you cannot win.  its impossible to win.  you will never do it.  but guess what?!  i dont believe them. I believe i can do it.  I CAN WIN.  And i will damnit.  but...oh...wait...im getting a text..../....whats this?  NO!  NO IT CANNOT BE!  I WAS SO CLOSE TO COMPLETING MY  DREAM, AND IT WAS ENDED AGAIN BY THOSE 5 TERRIFYING WORDS....i was so close to winning...so close....until he texted me those 5 words....just 5 words...made my dreams fly out the door.  because....&quot;I lost the game&quot;
