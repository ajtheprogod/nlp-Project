    <ChosenAnswer>Yahoo requires you to have a Yahoo mail plus account which is $19.99 for a year. I do not know if one account would work for all 4 email accounts or not...

If you have a Yahoo mail plus account, or if you are going to get one, here is how to set it up to Outlook:

            <Content>You have to look into something called YPOPS!

Yahoo doesn&#039;t allow you to natively forward or use a 3rd party mail client to manage the email and hotmail doesn&#039;t allow forwarding altogether, but you can use POP3 to access that one through outlook.</Content>
