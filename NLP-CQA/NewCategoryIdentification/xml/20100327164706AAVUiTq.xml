    <ChosenAnswer>It means that if you have some sort of limited plan with your isp where you&#039;re charged for bandwith, usage fees, etc. your isp will charge you for accessing that site and voting the same way they charge you for accessing other sites. If you have unlimited internet you don&#039;t have anything to worry about.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It does not mean extra fees, it is just telling you that by voting, you are using your internet connection and therefore will be billed by your ISP at your standard fees for the content.</Content>
