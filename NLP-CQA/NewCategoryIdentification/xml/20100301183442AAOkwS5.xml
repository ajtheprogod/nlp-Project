  <Question id="20100301183442AAOkwS5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>what about twitter...?</Subject>
    <Content>do you like? i have one with my friend. mostly we spam it with song and movie quotes. and the only people we really follow are people in bands and some others. i don&#039;t really get what makes it so amazing, but its fun.
so why do you like twitter?
i so totally agree! i don&#039;t give a sh*t what your doing. i like it to be worth while. at least quotes make you look something up if you want to have an idea what they are talking about
