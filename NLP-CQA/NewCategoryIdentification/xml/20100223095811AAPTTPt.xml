  <Question id="20100223095811AAPTTPt" type="Answered">
    <Subject>CollectionStop.com reviews?</Subject>
    <Content>I can&#039;t find any reviews on this website.

My wife bought me a concert DVD from CollectionStop and, I found a problem with the DVD. I tried it in two different DVD players but still had the same problem.

I have e-mailed the website once already with no reply(I e-mailed them a second time, but, that was only a couple minutes ago) after several days. I have a feeling(but I hope not), my wife was scammed.

So, Has anyone heard of this website?
JohnnyCage, I hope you are right.

            <Content>It&#039;s a large website and i doubt it&#039;s a scam, maybe you just have to wait for a response. I personally have never ordered anything from it but deciding from the way it&#039;s built and it&#039;s size, I doubt it&#039;s a scam.</Content>
