    <Subject>Why does Yahoo keep &#039;effing around with my homepage?</Subject>
    <Content>Why does Yahoo keep &#039;effing around with my homepage? Just to be CLEAR, I am NOT talking about MyYahoo. I am talking about the regular Yahoo page. I get the &#039;effer the way I want it and then some hillbilly, or maybe some doeling, over at Yahoo comes along and moves stuff around on my homepage. What&#039;s up with these people? I don&#039;t bother anybody, so why don&#039;t they leave my homepage alone already?!! Doesn&#039;t Yahoo know that if it isn&#039;t broken then they shouldn&#039;t be fixing it?! &#039;EFF!

    <ChosenAnswer>Yahoo is doing a lot of bullsheet stuff all over the place.
They seem to be moving away from user friendly, to advertising dollar generation, at the expense of the former.
I grow increasingly dismayed with these annoyances, as you are, but the entire Internet is being swept up in this craze...and they don&#039;t ask if you want the change: they just go ahead and do it.</ChosenAnswer>
