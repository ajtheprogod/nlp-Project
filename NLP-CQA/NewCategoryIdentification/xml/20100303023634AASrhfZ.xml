    <Subject>Weird problems going on in FormSpring.Me?</Subject>
    <Content>I have this weird problem where I log into my account and when I just press on &#039;Following&#039; or &#039;Profile&#039;, it just turns into someone else&#039;s account! This has happened so many times and I&#039;m really confused... it&#039;s just breaking into other people&#039;s accounts without me doing anything. I really want to see the answers people put to my questions but whenever I press &#039;Following&#039; it just turns into a complete stranger&#039;s account. Please help!
