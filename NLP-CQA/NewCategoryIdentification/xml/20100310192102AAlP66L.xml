    <ChosenAnswer>Yea, just re-install it.  Look up ur computer to uninstall it then try reinstall it.  

If it still messes up, try call your company and ask what&#039;s up.  Could be some problem other people have if it&#039;s just happening.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>yeah...mike you can&#039;t exactly reinstall a router.

move the router to a different spot in the room and try your luck if it still drops then you might have to look for a wireless extender and they&#039;re not cheap...your best luck is to try some routers out until you find the right on that works well enough where you want it. I&#039;ve went through at least 6 last year cause the signal was not reaching far enough. linksys dlink etc..Routers are hit or miss</Content>

            <Content>The problem here is probably the wire from the wall to the router. I had that problem before it is actually caused by the dryness of the room and the wire, it then causes static electricity and stops the information from going thru the wire. I recommend you to unplug the telephone wire from your router and plug it back after passing your finger over the metallic part of the plug. Good luck!</Content>
