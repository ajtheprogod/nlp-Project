            <Content>it&#039;s possible that the DNS info has been lost.. she can retrieve this info and instructions from her internet service provider. If she is connected to a router have her reset the router by unplugging it and holding down the tiny reset button with the sharp end of a pencil for 20 seconds. Also reset the modem by unplugging for 1 minute and plugging  back in... disconnect the lan cables between these items while doing so, so that they don&#039;t see eachother before they are ready.</Content>
