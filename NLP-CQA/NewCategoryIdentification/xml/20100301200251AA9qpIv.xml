    <ChosenAnswer>Did she specify that she wanted the item returned? Seeing as shes already refunded you it doesnt appear that she does but then again she may not know what shes doing. Who knows? I would contact her &amp; ask what she would like to do. Maybe she thinks its not worthwhile returning due to the return postage costs.

She sent you a request to cancel the transaction so she can recover her final value fees. There is nothing wrong with accepting this request. 

Never heard of &#039;losing your ebay/paypal coverage for when you cancel transactions&quot; I have cancelled transactions before with no penalty/strike against my name. If concerned contact paypal or ebays live chat.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The Seller has been extremelly honest and helpful to refund you without receiving the goods back; however as they were defective you should not be out of pocket to return them.
Ask the seller if they would like back (it is their property now) and they should refund (beforehand) the P+p or to arrange collection.
Nothing bad will happen to your account- you have done nothing wrong.
Accept the mutual cancellation so the seller can get their fees back</Content>
