    <ChosenAnswer>PayPal is a good way to send or receive money. You can setup multiple bank accounts to ur paypal setup and buy or transfer funds to other bank accounts w/ out showing personal info.

I wouldnt trust any other online site to handle transactions because paypal at least refunds your money.</ChosenAnswer>
