    <ChosenAnswer>John C is a liar i&#039;ve gotten HALO2 for my computer from there. General redemptions are once every month and lockerz will tell you when its redemption day but won&#039;t tell you the exact time. AS for member redeption you have to pay 100 points to go to one. Its basically so you can increase your chance of winning.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Redemption dates will be announced on your main locker home page. Redemptions will be once a month, for now.

Member Redemption: Pointz have to be paid for a person to be able to participate in the Member Redemption, therefore, less people will be participating. And in turn, you will have a better chance of getting the prize you wish to receive. This is good, since there is a limited stock of items.

General Redemption: Just a general redemption. No participation fee, but you have a lower chance of getting the prize you want. Anyone can redeem a prize during the general redemption.</Content>
