  <Question id="20100311013943AAf0Gms" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I stop Internet Explorer displaying history in new tabs?</Subject>
    <Content>I know how to delete the history afterwards, but how do I prevent the history being shown in the first place? I have Internet Explorer 8 and whenever I open a new tab, the page always shows the history under the guise of: &quot;View tabs that you&#039;ve closed since starting Internet Explorer.&quot; Without even trying, anyone can see exactly what I&#039;ve been looking at. How can I stop it showing a list or previously visited websites? The information is quite detailed; for example, it doesn&#039;t just show answers.yahoo.com; rather it shows the exact title of the question I was looking at. Bah, it&#039;s annoying the h*ll out of me. Thanks.
I tried browsing  using the &quot;InPrivate&quot; function but it doesn&#039;t solve the problem.
I don&#039;t have google toolbar; the problem is with internet explorer 8 itself.

            <Content>Go into Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Tabs&gt;Settings
From there you can control what the new tab opens with.

For future reference, check out InPrivate Browsing, a feature that allows you to browse without leaving a trace:
