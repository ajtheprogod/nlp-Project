    <ChosenAnswer>I had a b*tch of a time when I installed IE8, so I got rid of that crap, my personal opinion.  Go to cnet.com and look up internet explorer downloads.  I think it has a test to detect what kind you have and will install a new version, older or newer, for free.  Then unistall the problem IE.

If that doesn&#039;t help google free internet explorer help.  Hope that helps a little.</ChosenAnswer>
