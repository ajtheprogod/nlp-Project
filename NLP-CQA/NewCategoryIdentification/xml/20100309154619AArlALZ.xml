    <ChosenAnswer>Basically, a search and win site is a search engine. (eg, MSN, Yahoo, Google) Now, whenever you search, you either win points or cash. Then you can get some free prizes!

So, basically:

Search: Search and randomly win points or cash
Win: Get your free prizes!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>a search and win site is any one of swagbucks&#039; sites. the best one to use is the main website, swagbucks.com. just enter the code in under your account info on the homepage and you will get the SBs. they also have other affiliated websites, but the SBs you get on those sites can usually only be used for rewards on those sites. if you want to check out the other S&amp;W sites, the left side of the blog page has all of the links. just remember that if you use the code on the SB homepage, you can use the rewards on anything, but if its on one of the other sites, your usage is restricted. so choose wisely.

where did you find an 18 SB code?</Content>
