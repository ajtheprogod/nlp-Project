    <Subject>How can I view a website that has been taken offline?</Subject>
    <Content>To do research for a project, I need to be able to see a webpage that I know used to exist but has now been taken offline.  One of my friends knew there was a way to see it but that he didn&#039;t know how to do it.

    <ChosenAnswer>There are 3 ways to do this, generally.

Only 2 of them are applicable in your current status of affairs.

In short:

1. Go to archive.org as was mentioned by others.

2. Google the website and click the &quot;Cached&quot; link beside the URL it displays in the results (the URL should be in green.

The third option is to prepare beforehand. I know this is the internet and people view websites as gods, but they&#039;re vulnerable to things like power outages, network and hardware failures, human errors, and still require funds to be kept online. You can always download a program to, or manually, save the site to your computer, so you can view it if the site goes down, or even if you don&#039;t have internet at some point.

Good luck.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You should be able to locate it through the internet archives, although keep in mind it is probably not going to be a credible source if it is offline.

Just type in &quot;internet archives&quot; in your search engine, follow the link and type in the website address in the address bar the website gives you.

OR go to this link: http://www.archive.org/web/web.php</Content>
