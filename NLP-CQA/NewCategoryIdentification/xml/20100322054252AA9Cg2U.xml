  <Question id="20100322054252AA9Cg2U" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why doesn&#039;t formspring ever work?</Subject>
    <Content>The view &quot;more&quot; questions never works. When you click on following a red note is there stating that its having difficultly. And sometimes formspring itself has an error when trying to access the site!

What is the deal? Everyones complaining.
@ Ching Chong: Have some maturity.
