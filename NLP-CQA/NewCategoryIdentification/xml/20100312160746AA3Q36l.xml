  <Question id="20100312160746AA3Q36l" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Help!!! Someone&#039;s using my email address...?</Subject>
    <Content>I checked my inbox today for the first time and found 50 emails from MyYearbook and formspring. The problem is, I don&#039;t and never had an account with either of these sites. I was wanting to know if my brother or sister was using my email to create one so decided to check it out. A guy (I&#039;m a girl) that is my age and has the same last name as me from across the country is the actual culprit. It&#039;s quite possible that he mistyped his own address as these were the only emails that I had directed to him and my password has not been changed. However, I don&#039;t want someone using my address. I searched the Help topics on both sites and found nothing. 
My question is, what can I do about this?! Thanks so much.

            <Content>First, if your friends {contacts} on your email use Myyearbook or Formspring they could be trying to get you to join. 

Next, go to Myyearbook.com and click on the forgot password and type in your email address. See if there is an account with your email address.
Do the same for Formspring.</Content>
