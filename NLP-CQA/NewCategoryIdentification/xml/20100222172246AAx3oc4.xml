    <ChosenAnswer>You mean that your IP was banned. If that is the case... Changing your internet provider will also change your IP. So, this time try to follow the rules so you are not banned. Anyway; If the offense was minor I think you could get rid of the ban by sending an apology email to the moderator or admin.</ChosenAnswer>
