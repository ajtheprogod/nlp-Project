  <Question id="20100314220004AA656zu" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can you tell me how did they found my address?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok so I won&#039;t get into the story but someone just threatened me in an email and said they know where I live... they typed my address next to the threat.  So how did they find my address?
I&#039;m not listed.  I live with my mom and stepdad who both have a different last name from mine.  I searched endlessly online for my name matching my address.  Nothing came up.  Were they stalking me?  Or is there a site I don&#039;t know about that would show this information?  
Seriously, I&#039;m not listed.  I&#039;m freaked out.  I don&#039;t even have my phone under my real name or address.  I may have in the past but have changed my number since then....

    <ChosenAnswer>Well JAcob if someone knows your IP address they can tell a lot of things about you, definitely about your city of residence

But getting your home address is somewhat a bit too much.

Seems to me some friend of your playing a prank on you, sending you a mail from another fake email id to bully you or something.</ChosenAnswer>
