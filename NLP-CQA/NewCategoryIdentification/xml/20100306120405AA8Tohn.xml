    <ChosenAnswer>I can see you panicked. (I hate PayPal!) What you did was first send the money from PayPal to your account, and the transaction completes in for 4-5 days, then you sent money from your bank account to your PayPal account, and this transaction also completes in 4-5 days. The money will appear in your bank account momentarily in 4-5 days and then shortly after $50 will be sent from your bank account to PayPal. I think you can call PayPal to cancel the transaction if you do not want to waste time waiting.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Paypal does things their own way.  There could be a number of reasons that what you described happened.  The only way to find out is to ask.  Email customer support at Paypal.</Content>
