  <Question id="20100225101914AA9hqmj" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why all the products available on internet (above all downloadable e.books) come with a Money Back Guarantee?</Subject>
    <Content>I know a lot of people that buy them and then ask - and get - a full refund.
How do they expect to get money if anybody ask for a refund?

    <ChosenAnswer>First, if you’re selling a quality product the few people will ask for a refund. Only in the case of being unsatisfied would you ask for a refund so many do not.
Secondly it’s required. Many affiliate companies (like clickbank, paydotcom) require a 60 day money back guarantee if you want to use them as a payment processor.
Third, it’s just good business. If someone is unhappy you should give them their money back and it’s possible that they’ll buy from you again, because you were honest.

Bottom line is, happy customers don’t ask for refunds so, make your customers happy. 
Are there people that will take advantage of generosity? Always, but fortunately they’re in the few.</ChosenAnswer>
