    <Subject>Firefox keeps upgrading itself when I don&#039;t want it to?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;d decided long ago not to upgrade to the new version of Firefox.  I&#039;m required to use Firefox for my work, &amp; many of my colleagues reported the new version sometimes clashed with our work&#039;s toolbar.  Last week I accidentally upgraded.  Sure enough, my pc kept on taking turns crashing &amp; freezing.

I got my pc repaired &amp; I downloaded the old version of Firefox.  However, it seems to suddenly &quot;morph&quot; from the old look to the new look without any prompting.  What is causing this?  And how can I stop it?  I actually prefer the old look &amp; I&#039;m scared the new one will cause problems again.  Please help!

    <ChosenAnswer>Do what you did before and reinstall the old version of Firefox. 

To stop automatic updating of Firefox, go to &quot;Tools, select &quot;Options&quot;, select the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, select the &quot;Update&quot; tab. Under &quot;When updates to Firefox are found&quot;, select the dot beside &quot;Ask me what to do.&quot;

Firefox will prompt/nag you when a update is available, but you have the option to install it or not install it.</ChosenAnswer>
