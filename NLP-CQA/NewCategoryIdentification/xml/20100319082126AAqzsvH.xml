  <Question id="20100319082126AAqzsvH" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Blocking a number. Will I still be changed by company?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok i got a text &#039;claiming&#039; I&#039;d signed up to some website called 247 sms to get unlimited free text messages for £4.50 per week. I didn&#039;t sign up for this ¬_¬ Anyway, I topped up my phone &amp; this company took £4.50 straight from my credit. Then they sent me two messages charging me £1.50 each! On one of the text messages it said to cancel the subscription text this number so I did but they texted me yet again &amp; charged me for the text. They haven&#039;t canceled it! If I block the number from texting me will I still be charged by this company?
I texted stop and received a message saying &#039;You have unscribed + will receieve no more texts. Click here to receive a free £10 leaving present&#039;

Then they texted me about 2 hours later reminding me I have free text messages ¬_¬

    <ChosenAnswer>From what I know of this sort of thing your supposed to phone the text number and text STOP.

If you don&#039;t they will keep sending them and charge you for them.

That&#039;s why when I get the odd one I delete it straight away. I dont even open it.</ChosenAnswer>
