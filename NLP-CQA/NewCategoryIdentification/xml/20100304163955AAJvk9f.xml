    <ChosenAnswer>That depends on a few things...

1) Did the Administrator(s) of that bored just ban that account?

2) Did the Administrator(s) block your IP? 

If you can make a new account, try that...though any good Admin will notice the exact IP and probably just re-ban you. Your better off emailing an Admin on that forum and try to work it out.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You didn&#039;t give much info to really help much, but try this.

If you log in with your email, try another email address, most likely you are blocked by your IP address though, in that case you will probably have to go to another location.</Content>
