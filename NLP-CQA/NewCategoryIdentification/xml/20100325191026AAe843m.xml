    <ChosenAnswer>There are so many chat rooms, you should give some more details what you like and what you prefer, anyway, I like to use the chat of Frenzoo, it&#039;s an virtual world, where you can chat but also join contest and create items for your 3-d avatar. They are hosting this Sunday (March 28) a chat event where everyone is matched to another gender, i joined the last one and had pretty fun. It&#039;s free you just need to run a plug in to start, other good chat places are Secondlife or Meez. Try them.</ChosenAnswer>
