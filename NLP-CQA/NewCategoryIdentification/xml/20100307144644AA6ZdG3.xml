  <Question id="20100307144644AA6ZdG3" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does anyone know of any sites where I can buy cigarettes and not have to pay the taxes at the end of the year?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m from New York, and the price of cigarettes is up to 10 dollars around me, and I refuse to pay that much. I&#039;ve seen some sites online that have cartons for 50 bucks, but I&#039;ve heard that with sites like that, they somehow screw you and make you pay the extra money...I dunno. Is this true? Are these sites trust worthy? Can anyone recommend any no-strings-attached sites?

    <ChosenAnswer>No.  You are legally required to pay your state&#039;s sales tax on cigarettes.  You can do so at the time of purchase, or at the end of the year (if you use those websites).  You could just buy from those websites and hope they don&#039;t find you, I guess, but there is no other legal solution.</ChosenAnswer>
