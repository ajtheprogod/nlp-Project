    <Subject>How to delete browsing history in internet explorer?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok, so I my friend decided to look up porn on my computer and I don&#039;t want my wife to freak out. I deleted all the history, changed the settings, etc etc. However, when I click the down arrow in the address bar, some porn sites show up and won&#039;t go away. i&#039;ve also clicked the X next to them and they disappear only to reappear the next time i start IE. What&#039;s up with that and how do i get rid of it?

Also, it doesn&#039;t show up anywhere in my history or anything, just right there in that &#039;auto-complete&#039; box. For now I have auto complete turned off, so it won&#039;t show up, but that only temporarily covers up the problem. Some help please? And don&#039;t direct me to a site to buy/download software.
The thing is, I deleted everything. Ctrl+Shift+delete and deleted temps, cookies, etc...deleted auto-complete files, cleared all history and everything. I know my way around most of this stuff, but I&#039;m stumped as to why this will not go away. Any clue as to why?
I even reset ie settings to default because it was supposed to restore all original crap, and guess what? it&#039;s still there. this is too weird. help

            <Content>Go to tools see the drop down menu click it  then  check delete browsing history.
That&#039;s it at least on i.e. 7.0

Otherwise there is a way to go into control panel and there is a spot to delete history delete cookies .
