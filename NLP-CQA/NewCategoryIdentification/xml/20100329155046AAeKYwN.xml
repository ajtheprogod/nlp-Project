    <ChosenAnswer>Your browser may have a hijacker/malware. The CPU working non stop will cause it to heat up and the fan will kick on full speed to cool it down. 

When you close your browser does the cpu usage drop back down?

Try running an antimalware application like malwarebytes. 
http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php
Install it, update it, run it. then check again. 
I also recommend running it from Safe Mode. 
Reboot pc, press F8 until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears on the screen and choose Safe mode. But be sure to update malwarebytes before hand. 
It does a great job of removing any hijackers/spyware/malware, etc.</ChosenAnswer>
