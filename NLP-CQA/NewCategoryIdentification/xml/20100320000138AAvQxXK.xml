  <Question id="20100320000138AAvQxXK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How reliable is Yahoo for a website host?</Subject>
    <Content>My website is going offline a lot, and I am wondering if this might only be temporary or if this is going to happen every once in a while. 
I was informed that Yahoo would be an excellent host, as they are a very large company, so there should be very little downtime. But in the last 24 hours my website has been going offline a lot.

So, how reliable is Yahoo, and how often will my site have downtime? 
Does Yahoo have a lot of downtime?

            <Content>In general I would avoid Yahoo as a website hosting company.  They are many cheaper website hosting companies that offer the same features and a ton of freedom to do what you want.  And they NEVER have downtime.  I refer to this website when I am about to purchase because they have a snapshot of the most reliable companies and its simple to read. http://thehostjudge.com/fullcomparison.html .</Content>
