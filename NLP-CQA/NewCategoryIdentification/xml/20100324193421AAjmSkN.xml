    <Subject>What should I name my character on pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver?</Subject>
    <Content>I have NO idea what to name my character on pokemon heartgold/soulsilver and I need your help to find me a name. I am really into japanese names so if you know any that would be good. I pick the boy character on the game. Also do you have a rival person in the game and do you name her?

Thanks.
