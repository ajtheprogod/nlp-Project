    <ChosenAnswer>Not by itself. Try using a program to search for spyware and viruses. You could try something free like AVG, but if it comes up with nothing (and your computer is still significantly slower) you may need something along the lines of Norton or McAfee. You could also upgrade your RAM. I wouldn&#039;t suggest laying out the money for a new GPU or CPU unless it&#039;s really important to you.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>That may cause your computer slow. Tell the internet connection supplier the detailed information about the error and ask for help from them. If your computer is still slow, you can use RegistryMum to clean the registry and defrag the disk.

            <Content>It can be on the reason. But not mostly... as Windows 7 has firewall configured for internet.
Spywares and torzans are free to hit our machines.
Please configure good antivirus and firewall for your pc like eset nod or eset smart security.</Content>
