    <ChosenAnswer>you need&#039;nt worry. I am on Sky but I can still access my e-mails in my yahoo account and my wife still uses her btinternet e-mail account. My children still use their yahoo accounts as well. So as I said don&#039;t worry as everything will carry on as normal. It will only be your internet provider that changes. I think you have made a good choice with Sky by the way. Good luck.</ChosenAnswer>
