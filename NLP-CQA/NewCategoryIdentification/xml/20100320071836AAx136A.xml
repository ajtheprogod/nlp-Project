    <ChosenAnswer>The fastest and easiest way to get money for your paypal is to start doing market research, which means becoming a consumer consultant and getting paid for your opinions. Many market research companies have panels specifically for teens, and you fit right into that category. So, on my blog, I have a list of market research companies that I am a member of, and all have paid me very nicely, I also have tips that others are scared to give. These are legit companies that will pay you, either via check or paypal. I make anywhere from $150 to $300 plus a month for just a few hours of my time. Just check it out for yourself and then decide. I have done all the work, research, checked them out with the BBB, read reviews before joining, and they are all legit. Here is a link to my blog, and best of luck to you. http://piper-of-pipers-lair-blog.blogspot.com/

            <Content>It is called file hosting. Have files that people want. They download them and you get payed for each download. It is only a few cents a download but if you have enough people downloading it then it adds up. The various sites are http://www.hotfile.com     http://www.rapidshare.com   http://www.depositfiles.com   etc.

The trick is finding files that people want to download and finding those files.</Content>
