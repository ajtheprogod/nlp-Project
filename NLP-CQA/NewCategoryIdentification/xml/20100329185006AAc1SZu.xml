    <Subject>Internet problem....?</Subject>
    <Content>I have at&amp;t elite its 6.0 mbs. The problem is when there are people on both the desktops we have that are wireless and im trying to play my xbox 360 online. I get some lag and dropped from online matches only when someone is on the desktops. Currently just using the 2wire modem/router and my xbox 360 is direct connect. Would it help if i got just a modem to run my xbox and move the 2wire to the living room to run the desktops.

    <ChosenAnswer>It will only help if the modem is running through a separate account. The problem here is bandwidth. If all three units are processing maximum loads, then each is only using a third of the bandwidth allocated under your account (which explains the lag).

You can purchase more bandwidth under your current account with AT&amp;T, if they have it.

or

You can buy an additional account, and use those resources only for the xBox</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You could try it, but I don&#039;t know that it would really make that much of a difference. You would still be using the same amount of bandwidth. Since your xbox is already direct connected, adding a modem would not help you.</Content>

            <Content>That might help but if it doesn&#039;t then maybe you could ask a expert on computers.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>You are probably maxing out your bandwidth, so, no, an additional modem would be of no help at all. at&amp;t would be who to ask about bandwidth.</Content>
