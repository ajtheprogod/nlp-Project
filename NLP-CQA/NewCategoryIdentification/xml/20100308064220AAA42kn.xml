  <Question id="20100308064220AAA42kn" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does anyone &quot;normal&quot; use Chatroulette?</Subject>
    <Content>After hearing about it on the dailyshow, I went to the website. 10 minutes in and I can&#039;t even count how many strange things I saw. Does anyone who isn&#039;t freaky use the site, or is it just a bunch of crazies showing their body parts?

    <ChosenAnswer>It has been around for quite a while and has built up a large fan base among people who like to &quot;troll&quot; (people that do something that they know others will find offensive with the primary goal of getting strong reactions).  Out of this group of users, I would have to say that at least half of them are using some form of webcam emulation (you are seeing a recorded webcam from someone else, not the actual user).  
This particular group of people wouldn&#039;t be interested if they thought there were no normal people to offend.

I would say that 75% of the people are simply trying to get a reaction out of you, and 25% &quot;normal&quot; users just doing it for fun.</ChosenAnswer>
