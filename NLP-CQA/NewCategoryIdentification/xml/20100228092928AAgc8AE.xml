  <Question id="20100228092928AAgc8AE" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I find his blog from his email address ?</Subject>
    <Content>I liked this guy, I met on a forum, and got his email address, then googled it, so got a search telling me that he has a blog, but I couldn&#039;t ever find it. How can I find it ?
i don&#039;t want to email him, as he doesn&#039;t know I like him.. I feel deeply in love, which I know could be silly!

    <ChosenAnswer>He didn&#039;t mention it in his forum profile?

Maybe he *used* to have a blog and took it down.  If it shows up in a Google search, try reading a cached version of it.</ChosenAnswer>
