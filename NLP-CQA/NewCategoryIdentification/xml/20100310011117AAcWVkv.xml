    <ChosenAnswer>Your question must stay open for at least four hours.  Once you submit you open questions, wait four hours.  Then go to your profile page.  About half way down the page you will see 4 tabs with the headings; My Answers, My Questions, My Starred Questions, My Watch List.  Click on the tab labeled &quot;My Questions,&quot; it should be the second tab.  You questions will appear and list in the order you submitted them, most recent one first.  It should already say in bright orange letters &quot;Choose Best Answer,&quot; Once you click on the question your answers will list and as long as each answer has a blue tab under it you just click the answer you want to vote.  Now if after 4 hours this option does not appear than you have a problem.</ChosenAnswer>
