    <Subject>School virus problem?</Subject>
    <Content>Our school had a problem with the pagefile.exe virus and the teachers found out and started taking action by running scans on everything and trying to get it off. They worked hard on trying to get it off and thought they had it under control.
But they did not and i dont think they know it because i plugged my flashdrive into the library computer a couple days ago to print a file. then i plug my flashdrive into my laptop a couple minutes later. a couple seconds after i plugged it in, my virus scanner detected it and i was able to get it off, but i had to format my flashdrive because everything was getting infected. I backed up all my data so it was alright to delete my files. I know the computers are infected because my virus scanner never found anything on it before i plugged it into the school computer. Well, i kinda forgot about the virus and my flashdrive has been through all of my computers and they all got infected, so i spent hours fixing them and finally got rid of the virus from all my computers and my flash drives and i was really pissed off too.
I am afraid to plug my flash drives into the school computers but i always have to print papers from my school printer. We also have work days in class for school projects and i would have to plug my flash drive into the computers like everyone else. All of the other students dont know about it. What should i do? I am getting really tired of getting infected from the school computers.
please help
