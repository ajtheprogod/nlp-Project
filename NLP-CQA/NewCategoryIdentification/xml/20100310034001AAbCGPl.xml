    <ChosenAnswer>Are you pinging the same site that you are trying to view? Sometimes nameserver problems do not allow you to see sites even though you are connected to the Internet.

Check your computer for virus. Also find out if you are behind a firewall which is blocking you.

Next try www.whois.sc/sitename and check the IP of the site - then try to access the site directly by IP. This only works if the site you are referring to has a dedicated IP.
