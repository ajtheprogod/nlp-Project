    <ChosenAnswer>If you already took them to court, who won?  Because if you won, and the court declared that they owe you money, they HAVE to pay or they are in contempt of court, and you can haul them back.  

Finding employment info on someone is tricky, since depending on the company they are now working for, the company does NOT have to disclose if they are working there.  I work in retail, and sometimes get calls from unknown people, asking to verify employment of someone, and every time we have to say that we can&#039;t give out personal information.  

Best bet would be to try a private investigator, or pay for an online background check.  try www.anywho.com to look this person up by name, or phone number, and they have links to reputable background searchers.  They can sometimes run $15-35, approximately.</ChosenAnswer>
