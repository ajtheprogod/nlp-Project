    <ChosenAnswer>OK you have found an item you want, you place your maximum bid (the most you are prepared to pay) For example start price on the item is $10.00 you are prepared to pay $20.00, so you enter $20. If you are the first bidder, the price will still be $10 &amp; you will be the current highest bidder. If no one else bids, the item will be yours for $10 + whatever the postage costs are.

Using the same example if someone else bids &amp; they were to place a bid of say $15.00, they will be immediately outbid as ebay is bidding on your behalf (automatic or proxy bidding) Then the price will then be $15.50 ( 50 cents is the increment at this stage) If they bid again at $20.00 the same as you, you will still be the highest bidder as the earlier placed bid takes priority.(its a bit of a give away on your max bid when this happens as there wont be an increment ) Now this other bidder really wants the item as well, so they place another bid of $25.00. You will no longer be the highest bidder &amp; provided no one else bids, they will win the bid for $20.50. 

BTW No one else knows your max bid just you.

The increment that I mentioned before ranges on the current price of the auction. It increases when the bidding goes over certain $ values. I think if bidding goes over $25 the increment is $1, then over $100 it increases again.

            <Content>The maximum is so that ebay will automatically out bid someone for you if they try to bid higher, up to the max that you set. That is, what you&#039;re willing to spend on the item. It&#039;s so that you don&#039;t have to go back and keep raising the bid little by little and you don&#039;t have to worry about someone coming in at the last second and outbidding you by just a little bit.</Content>
