    <Subject>How to download the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>Hey guys I asked this on UK answers but they are all idiots.
Hey I have 6GB of internet usage a month, I&#039;ve got about 2GB left this month and I&#039;ve got tons of stuff to do on the internet. I consider myself pretty tech savvy but I just can&#039;t find a website where I can download the internet. I&#039;ve got 2GB of usage left and like 100GB of hard drive space so size won&#039;t be an issue I just wanna download it all now so I don&#039;t just load pages wasting tiny bits of usage all the time just download it all at once so I can use the internet without wasting usage. Anyone know any website? Where I can download the internet?
Please don&#039;t link me some retarded website like www.downloadmoreram.com Im not an idiot.
@koin ......yeah and delete my hard drive? nice attempt...idiot..
@Xfacta   *sigh* I hate trolls...

    <ChosenAnswer>no one can &quot;download&quot; the internet the way you seem to be wanting to by the way you ask that question. you can visit web sites and you can add to your &quot;favorites&quot; list as many sites as you may like where you can get there faster, but there is no such thing as &quot;downloading the internet&quot; sorry !</ChosenAnswer>
