    <ChosenAnswer>DO NOT GO TO PIRATEBAY! I REPEAT DO NOT. You sir, are an idiot, and if you use piratebay, I would like to inform you that you possibly have thousands of viruses. PirateBay has already been shut down by the federal government, and every torrent is linked to a virus, and you will most likely get hi-jacked. Use uTorrent, but use a safe website, such as http://www.h33t.com or http://www.demonoid.com.
