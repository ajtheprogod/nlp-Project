    <Subject>Mobile broadband dongle or home internet?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi guys,
I was wondering: I&#039;m moving out soon to live on my own. In my new flat, I don&#039;t want/ need a phone line but I use the internet several hours a day for my job and was wondering what would be my best option. Should I get one of those mobile broadband dongles or should I just get a phone line and home broadband/ wireless (bearing in mind I will never use the phone and have limited funds)? I would get a dongle as I&#039;m the only one who&#039;d need to use it but does that mean my usage is limited or it will be slower?
Any advice will be much appreciated!
xxx

            <Content>Mobile broadband is much slower and often has a very small monthly cap of only 5gb of bandwidth - and is also much more expensive.  Get a DSL or cable connection, it&#039;s both less expensive and offers much, much better performance.</Content>

            <Content>The dongle is an expensive way to get the internet  especially if you are medium to heavy user....Also the speeds you get from mobile broadband aren&#039;t really that good..Home broadband will probably cost you in the region of £30 per month , that&#039;s including your line rental , so you should see how many GB you get for that with mobile broadband ...</Content>

            <Content>Your use of the word &quot;flat&quot; suggests you might be in England.
You get free unlimited 2MB broadband with a Sky TV subscription
All dongles are limited - very limited.  I don&#039;t do anything crazy on the web but I needed to use it as my sole Internet for a couple of weeks and my allowance (15GB) ran out in eight days.
You could also try Talk Talk (from Carphone Warehouse).  Heavily promoted on TV but never used it myself</Content>
