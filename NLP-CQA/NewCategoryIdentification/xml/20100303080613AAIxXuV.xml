            <Content>ok, but what does the computer is doing, does it pop up any messages,have you seen a different icon on your desktop. my advice reboot in safe mode with networking and download malwarebytes antivirus, run it and remove anything it tells you. also download rkill.exe that will stop any harmful processes in you computer.</Content>

            <Content>1st, try System Restore. Doesn&#039;t always get rig of viruses though.

2nd, run a command prompt and type:
NETSH WINSOCK RESET
and Enter. Followed by rebooting the machine

3rd, Just do a registry restore (rather than a system restore). You&#039;ll need to use another PC and download a tool like Viceroy&#039;s Registry Restore Wizard. If you can do that you could also download Malware Bytes Anti-Malware for good measure.

4rth Create a new user account and see if all is accessible from there.

5th Backup and reinstall.</Content>
