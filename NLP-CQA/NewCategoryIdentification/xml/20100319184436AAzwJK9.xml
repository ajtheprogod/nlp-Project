    <ChosenAnswer>If you don&#039;t install RSBot properly, or compile it, you can have a really hard time. http://uppit.com/v/qagaih4p This is a RSbot Jar file, already precompiled with the standard free scripts, if you want to get more or specific scripts you will have to pay for them, check the rsbot.com forums for details.

            <Content>This &quot;free rs bot&quot; is actually a virus, according to a little research I did.  Get anti-virus software and get rid of the virus.  Deleting it off your desktop isn&#039;t enough.</Content>
