    <Subject>Unwanted adverts filling the entire monitor - normal?</Subject>
    <Content>I suddenly seem to be getting quite a lot of really annoying adverts which fill the entire screen, and they interupt whatever i am doing, randomly. For example, i will click on a site like Youtube, then suddenly an advert (cheap looking one, in the local language - Dutch, since I&#039;m in Holland), and the ONLY way to get rid of the advert it a small little click link at the top or bottom of the screen, saying &quot;skip ad&quot;.  Is this a virus or something i can stop from happening.

    <ChosenAnswer>I had something like this a long time ago and hubby told me to use Firefox instead with the Ad blocker installed.

I haven&#039;t had the same problem since, and as he&#039;s a techie I&#039;ll assume he knows what he&#039;s talking about.

So ditch IE and use Firefox instead and then problem solved :0)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I think you&#039;re being careless with your mouse, there have been loads of annoying ads lately, all it takes for them to come out is to rollover!

Try a pop-up blocker, it won&#039;t stop them all but it will help and be more careful where you scroll.</Content>

            <Content>On the &#039;Tools&#039; menu of your Internet browser, click on preferences and check whether the pop ups and cookies are blocked, if not then on the drop down box click on &#039;block all pop ups&#039;. Hope it will do.</Content>
