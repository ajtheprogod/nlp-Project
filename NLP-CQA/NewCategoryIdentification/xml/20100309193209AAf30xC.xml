  <Question id="20100309193209AAf30xC" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can someone tell me why I am having trouble accessing a certain section of this websight?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok they updated their websight and now I am having trouble with the patient login section.  There is no SUBMIT button and it does not allow you to read all the text in that section.  I am even having trouble submitting a complaint about the websight on that websight.  So if you go there click on patient login on upper left corner and tell me what you see, does it require a special application or version of an application that I don&#039;t have intstalled?  Does it require having high speed access?  http://www.haltomorthodontics.com/
