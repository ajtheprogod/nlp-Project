  <Question id="20100308202429AATCdhi" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there any charges/costs associated with using Blogger.com?</Subject>
    <Content>I am reviewing different social media websites for a uni assessment. One of the websites I am doing is Blogger.

Does anyone know if there are any costs associated with using Blogger? I&#039;ve looked all over their website and I can&#039;t see anywhere where cost is mentioned but I may have overlooked it.

    <ChosenAnswer>Blogger is the official blog site from Google to create your own webpage. Its a free service. You can choose your webpage name that goes like this www.(your webpage name).blogspot.com. I have been using Blogger for over 2 years now. Actually, there is an option called Google Adsense where you can have advertisement banners from Google free of cost and get paid if someone clicks the ad banner. They offer lot of templates and widgets to add to your page like videos from youtube, games from miniclip.com, etc. If you want more idea, check out my Blogger page www.ndulch.blogspot.com</ChosenAnswer>
