  <Question id="20100301171432AAOcrf6" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I get Google Chrome to keep me logged in to sites when I close the window?</Subject>
    <Content>When I opened a browser on my old computer, I could go to facebook and I would still be logged into fb from last time. But my new computer makes me log in to sites again any time I close the browser. How can I stay logged in?
I have windows 7 and my sites don&#039;t stay logged in.

            <Content>Most sites use what&#039;s known as a &#039;cookie&#039; to keep you logged into sites when you close your browser. So you don&#039;t usually need to worry about this, so long as its a decent website it should do it anyway. By the way have you tried a Google Chrome extension that shows you all recently visited sites and instant access to your favourite pages?
