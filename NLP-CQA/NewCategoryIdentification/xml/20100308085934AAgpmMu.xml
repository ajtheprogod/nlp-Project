            <Content>hi,I don&#039;t think there is a good website for making a slideshow which allows you to add music.
I have tried http://animoto.com/  before,which a free ,but later i realize it is so limited in functions and i need pay more for additional features.
So i bought the Wondershare Flash Gallery Factory,check their free trail: http://www.flash-slide-show.com/flash-slideshow-products.html
You can add and edit your background music with this software,hope it helps!</Content>
