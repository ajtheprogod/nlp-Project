    <ChosenAnswer>Enable port forwarding on your router to the port of your choosing (configurable in utorrent).
You could also enable uPnP on your router from the web interface.

People are stingy with knowledge for two factors:

1) People don&#039;t listen or care about details, often don&#039;t take the time to help themselves and are rude
2) We&#039;re providing a free service, if you have problems with that then by all means go be charged by your local computer shop.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The router should not be an issue unless there is a firewall on the router or blocked ports on the router.    You need admin access to the router to review these things</Content>

            <Content>I cant imagine why this may be a issue unless you switch your internet provider which some providers limit your upload speed causeing peer to peer to download much slower. I suggest reinstalling utorrent or restoring to default settings incase you had change some settings. For example if you lowered your upload speed your download speed will be lowed too. I hope  this helps.</Content>
