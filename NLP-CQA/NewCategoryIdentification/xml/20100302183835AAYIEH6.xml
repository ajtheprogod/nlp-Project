    <ChosenAnswer>there&#039;s no such thing as a subscription to Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi networks are private- you can set one up in your house- and any computer with a wi-fi card can connect to it. All the 3G (cell phone connection) plans come with a 5GB limit. AT&amp;T happens to operate several thousand wi-fi hotspots in coffee shops, bookstores, and airports around the country and if you have an AT&amp;T broadband connect card, they give you unlimited access to all of their hotspots.</ChosenAnswer>
