    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s pretty good. The arrival time varies a bit - I ordered the Devil May Cry 5th edition boxset a few months ago and it arrived within decent time, like five days or fewer. I was surprised and very pleased. On the other hand, I have ordered a few things and it took roughly one to two weeks. That may have been because the product was in low stock, but it wasn&#039;t too long. 
I like Super Saver shipping because 1) I&#039;m not terribly impatient, and 2) it&#039;s FREE! Some items&#039; shipping costs are more than the item itself, but if I do Super Saver shipping, it knocks that down. 
Hope this helps!</ChosenAnswer>
