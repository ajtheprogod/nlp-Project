            <Content>They are for internal disfunction of the brain cells. Raptors tend to eat cookies without knowing that they are really deciding prematurely that they are about to barf out their own asses. Chocolate chip cookies, however, tend to end up coming out of some fat dick holes ass with fucking corn attached to it. Snickerdoodle, while also sounding sexual, is a term for representing your mother who is so obese that she perspires mayonaisse. Raptor Jesus likes to eat babies but is very into cookies as well and will tell you that through him you will go to dino heaven and there the night is lighter than day. WHAT?? I know right. I wish you would stop reading this because at this point you should have figured out that i&#039;m just spouting out random nonsense. But no one really likes communists because they have government issues and theyre corrupt or some shit. Penises tend to look like cookies because cookies spout out semen in an orderly fashion. Daylight breaks hard on the sacred ground. For centuries we&#039;ve questioned them of his birth. but in this hour, on this day, the elder knew. That was a bit of an iced earth song. kryyyptonite!</Content>

            <Content>Cookies are used mainly to identify you on the internet. For example when you go to a site, it reads your cookie and sees who you are. If you have it set so that you stay logged in, you won&#039;t have to always log in when you visit that site. It also can show you the page as you have it set up. e.g., displays your local weather or the background colors you selected without having to log in.</Content>
