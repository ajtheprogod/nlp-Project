  <Question id="20100315150425AAbKQab" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there a website where you can find history about the house you currently live in?</Subject>
    <Content>My sister recently moved into a new house just a few weeks ago. She and her boyfriend has been concerned about if they have been experiencing paranormal activity around there house. A couple of books on a bookshelf dropped down to the floor when nobody was bothering it. A few days ago, they woke up to see the garage door wide open letting in a lot coldness in the kitchen. They have three cats, and they all have been acting strange in the house and always wants to stat with my sister Josie and her boyfriend, Tom. If anybody knows a website that can help me and see history of this house like seeing if anybody died in that house, please answer this question to help us. Thanks!! :)

    <ChosenAnswer>Well if not in local articles in library I reccommend going on the county auditor&#039;s web page (just google your county and write ______county&#039;s auditor page) then you can see the past owners who owned the house. Try to find articles of them online of in your library&#039;s archives. Good luck with the ghost!</ChosenAnswer>
