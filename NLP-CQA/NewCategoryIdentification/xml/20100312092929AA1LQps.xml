    <ChosenAnswer>Founded in San Jose, California on September 4, 1995 by Pierre Omidyar and Jeff Skoll as Auctionweb, part of a larger personal site that included, among other things, Omidyar&#039;s own tongue-in-cheek tribute to the Ebola virus.

The first item sold was Omidyar&#039;s broken laser pointer for $14.83. Astonished, he contacted the winning bidder and asked, &quot;did he not understand the laser pointer was broken?&quot; Omidyar received the following email in reply: &quot;I&#039;m a collector of broken laser pointers.&quot; (The frequently repeated story that eBay was founded to help Omidyar&#039;s fiancee trade PEZ Candy dispensers was fabricated by a public relations manager in 1997 to interest the media. This was revealed in Adam Cohen&#039;s 2002 book and confirmed by eBay.)

It officially changed its name to eBay in September 1997. Originally, the site belonged to Echo Bay Technology Group, Omidyar&#039;s consulting firm. Omidyar had tried to register the domain name EchoBay.com but found it already taken by the Echo Bay Mines, a gold mining company, so he shortened it to his second choice, eBay.com.

Margaret (Meg) Whitman joined the company in March 1998. She joined eBay when the company had 30 employees and operated solely in the United States; eBay is now a global organization with over 9,000 employees. Meg is credited with building the company to what it is today.

            <Content>Pierre Omidyar&#039;s business was Echo Bay Technology Group. He said he picked the words &quot;echo bay&quot; because they &quot;just sounded cool&quot;. When he went to start an online auction business, he checked &quot;echobay.com&quot; and it was taken by a mining company. He decided &quot;ebay.com&quot; was the second best name he could think of.</Content>
