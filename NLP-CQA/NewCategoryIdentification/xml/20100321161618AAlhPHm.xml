  <Question id="20100321161618AAlhPHm" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can the virus &#039;Vista Defender Pro&#039; be transmitted by USB keys?</Subject>
    <Content>I recently got the virus Vista Defender Pro (which is a fake anti-virus program that pretends you have a lot of viruses, and tries to make you buy an upgraded version of it to get rid of them, and slowly infects your computer unless you delete it) on my laptop, and although I managed to get rid of it, while it was still on my computer I backed up some files on my USB key. Is it safe to put my USB into a computer, or will it get the virus?
