  <Question id="20100306010340AAYtEbA" type="Answered">
    <Subject>i hate my ex-girlfriend sites?</Subject>
    <Content>isn&#039;t it funny how they&#039;re the same coding, the same layout, the same exact content, the same situation (cheating)... really? are these really made by angry ex-boyfriends? or just some nerdy webmaster that owns ALL of these sites and probably makes money off these referrals. bet these girls are just random ass girls found on other porn sites.

    <ChosenAnswer>I think they&#039;re fake. The girls in the pics are paid and the website owner gets paid per hit to the site.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Most likely fake, but it is true some guys can be very mean and petty following a break up.
When they finally grow up and mature, they realize you can actually remain friends with an ex- rather than apparently being at war like the young people</Content>

            <Content>Quite obviously designed to generate ad revenue. 

Sadly people genuinely are sad enough to spread the links around in the hope that they&#039;ll get to see some porn!</Content>
