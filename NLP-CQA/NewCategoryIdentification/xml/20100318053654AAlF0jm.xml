  <Question id="20100318053654AAlF0jm" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why do people prefer IE over Firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>I mean, IE is slower, makes that annoying &quot;click&quot; sound when you click on something (you know what I mean), has a confusing tab system, and crashes a lot more.

    <ChosenAnswer>I think it is because most people don&#039;t want to have to learn a new program, and because IE comes with all Windows computers, they use that.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Uh, you answered the most yourself! :) But there&#039;s also one more thing: the add-ons. There are thousand extenes for firefox out there, which are very helpful. From quick translating to mini-games and information abour your PC. You can find many of them here: https://addons.mozilla.org . I hope it helped.</Content>

            <Content>I think the majority of the reason is that it&#039;s what they know since it comes with Windows (except if you&#039;re in the EU, you get a choice there) and because they think there is ONE browser.

When I talk to my users about switching they seem unaware there IS a choice as they have been using IE so long or that it&#039;s what came with Windows.

It&#039;s basically akin to the saying &#039;you don&#039; know what you&#039;re missing&#039;. If you don&#039;t have anything for comparison you don&#039;t know how bad your existing option(s) are.</Content>
