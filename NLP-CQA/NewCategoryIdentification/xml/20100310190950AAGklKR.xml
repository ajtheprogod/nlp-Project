    <ChosenAnswer>Hey guys

I&#039;m working for this new company - http://yardsellr.com/D2s - it&#039;s a great place for you to sell all of the clothes and purses and stuff that you don&#039;t use anymore! Also, yardsellr is a great place to post unused tickets to sporting events and concerts

This company, &quot;yardsellr&quot; is based off the idea that people are, by nature, buyers and sellers and we want to make those processes as happy as they possibly can be. That&#039;s why we are trying to make the experience as easy, quick and efficient as possible.

Whenever something is posted, the item is marketed on your twitter and facebook so that all your friends can see the product and maybe buy it. It is also marketed on our twitter and all over the web (by our fabulous marketing team!)
