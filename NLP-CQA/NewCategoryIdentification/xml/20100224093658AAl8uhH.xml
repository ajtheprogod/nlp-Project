    <ChosenAnswer>its totally free to bid, and yes you need a credit/debt card to create an account to stop spammers and banned users rejoining. if the person has a contact us section.

            <Content>bidding is free but many sellers don&#039;t like first time buyers.
If possible get a friend who already has an account to buy for you.

            <Content>It doesn&#039;t cost to bid on an item.
You don&#039;t have to use a credit card. You can use a debit cardm through PayPal, which helps to protect your transactions. But if the item is cash on collection then you won&#039;t need to use one.</Content>

            <Content>No it&#039;s free to bid. You only pay if you win. I however do NOT recommend cash as a way for paying that is only asking for trouble. If you want to be 100% safe use paypal, credit card or check. If you use cash there will be no proof at all that you paid for the item.</Content>
