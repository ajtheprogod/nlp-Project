    <ChosenAnswer>If you are worried that the admin will block his account, you are right. However writing a quick letter apologizing for the hassle and explaining the situation should help. Most of the admins are understanding, mature people.

You should also change your password to something complicated (include at least one capital letter, 1 digit and one special character like $ # ! ^ etc) and make it as long as you are comfortable with.
