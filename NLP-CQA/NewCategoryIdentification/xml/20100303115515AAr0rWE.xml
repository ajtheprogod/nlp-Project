    <Subject>Anyone figured out how to alphabetize Firefox bookmarks??!?</Subject>
    <Content>What&#039;s up with alphabetizing Firefox&#039;s bookmarks?! I keep trying to no avail and it seems everyone else has too. Is there anyone out there who has figured this out???
Thanx!
I&#039;ve been on the Firefox site including forums and have had no luck with the specifics as to how to alphabetize bookmarks. I need the exact instructions so if someone knows exactly where it is on the site; url, etc. it would be great.

Poui, I did what you specified but it doesn&#039;t work when I click on the tool bar itself. I have to do the multi step process every time I want to pull up the bookmarks. Any other thoughts? Thanks a lot.

Poui, I did what you instructed but it doesn&#039;t maintain the alpha listing when I click Bookmarks on the tool bar itself. I have to do the multi step process every time I want to pull up the bookmarks. Any other options? Thanks a lot.
