  <Question id="20100227000021AAH7Bg8" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What&#039;s wrong with my Twitter?</Subject>
    <Content>I just created a new account.
I verified it and everything.
Then I went to search for people.
It didn&#039;t matter WHO&#039;S name I typed it, the same message appeared. &quot;Could not find anyone named __&quot;
I went through the Help section, and found nothing that helped me.
I don&#039;t even know how to contact Twitter and ask what&#039;s up.
So....
Someone please help me!!
I really needed this account for my business!!!
