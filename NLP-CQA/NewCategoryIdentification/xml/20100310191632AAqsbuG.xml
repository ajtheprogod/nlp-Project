    <ChosenAnswer>Just out of curiosity, can&#039;t you buy that at a regular store?

To answer your question, it could be either ups or usps (United States Postal Service) But &quot;via ground&quot; translates to &quot;slow&quot;, because it will not be transported by air. It has to get to you by ground travel.</ChosenAnswer>
