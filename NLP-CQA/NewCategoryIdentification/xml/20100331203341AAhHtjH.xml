    <ChosenAnswer>Not quite sure what the Asian midgets have to do with anything, but sounds interesting. Anyway, You can still use Amazon.com in Spain ( or Scotland ) if you choose, but it would be be wiser to use Amazon.co.uk.
    Spain does not yet have an Amazon.es  but almost all .co.uk   products are available for delivery overseas at a reasonable cost.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>In the Uk we have Amazon.co.uk. We can still use Amazon.com but it means paying in dollars and a fortune for delivery.

Dunno about spain but I&#039;m assuming they have amazon.esp or something like that.</Content>

            <Content>Yes we can access the .com domain but it is not really necessary. The .uk domain is for Scotland.

Amazon also have at least two distribution warehouses in Scotland serving all of UK and beyond.

Also, the Amazon Development Centre is actually based in Scotland. They develop new features and functionality for all Amazon&#039;s global websites.
