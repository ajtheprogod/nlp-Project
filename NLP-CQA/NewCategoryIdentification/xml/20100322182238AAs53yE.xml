    <ChosenAnswer>They can open a non paying bidder dispute then leave you a stike on your ebay account. 3 strikes &amp; ebay will terminate your account. Also alot of sellers have blocks in place to prevent those with strikes to bid on their items so you might find that you will be restricted next time you bid on something.

It could be a processing error on behalf of the seller? who knows? but the fact remains that you did purchase/bid on this item. Why bid on something you dont want? I dont understand why people do this???....Anyway either send it back if they have supplied a return address or do the honest thing &amp; pay for it.  Why should the seller be out of pocket?</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>i imagine you should send it back. Did you win the auction on ebay? If you did wint he auction and did not pay for the item, you will likely get a negative feedback point.

Contact the seller and make arrangements with them to satisfy them.</Content>

            <Content>Well its the sellers fault for shipping the item without you paying for it keep it and nothing will happen as its his fault he sent it to you it depends how much the item is worth if its under 20 i would keep it but if its over either pay him/her or ship it back because their loosing money this way and it would be wrong</Content>
