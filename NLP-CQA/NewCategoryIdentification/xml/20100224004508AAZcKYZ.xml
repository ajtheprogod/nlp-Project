    <ChosenAnswer>The required ratio varies from tracker to tracker.

The way to maintain a good ratio si to jump on popular uploads ASAP and leave them seeding for the next week or two at least.

Some methods will be either frowned upon or banned but you can do things like download just a small part of the torrent - onr 14mb rar out of the whole 700mb for example and then that will keep your download low but many people will take the 14mb. 

It&#039;s not really ethical though.

Best thing to do is just leave you max amount of torrents seeding for a good two weeks.

The other thing is to remember that most older files are available with good ratios on public trackers and to do the bulk of your downloading from those. Saving your private tracker to get good speeds on newer content.

You can also download everything on the private tracker that is FREE LEECH these are usually things like extraction software, operating systems and boxsets - entire seasons of shows/trilogies/quadrilogies etc of movies.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Long story short. You need to maintain they ratio from not to be banned from the sites. For example, you downloaded something which is of 100 MB, you need to seed(upload to others who are downloading like you ) the same until it reached 100 MB, thats making 1.0 ratio. If you upload the same for 150 MB then it 1.5 ratio. 200 MB is 2.0 ratio. 

Sharing is caring boy! Until someone shared you wouldn&#039;t have got it and until you share someone will not get it!</Content>
