  <Question id="20100322185159AALVFoD" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Buyer says he received an empty box?</Subject>
    <Content>I sold something on ebay and the buyer is telling me he received an empty box.  What do I do?  I know I sent him a phone and also taped the box.  The only way in the box was to cut the tape which he says was still on there.  He is either lying about the empty box or lying about the tape not being cut.
also paypal says i am eligable for seller protection

&quot;Protection for items not received

When you ship to the address on this page and provide proof that the item was delivered, you&#039;re protected against claims for items not received. For complete requirements, see terms.&quot;
He also threatened me physically over a voicemain if i dont send a refund tonight.

    <ChosenAnswer>Well if he opens a dispute saying the item was not received, you will provide your proof to paypal like you said.  I would think they would find in your favour.

Perhaps contact paypal they might be the best to answer in detail then anyone on here can or ask this question on ebays community boards &amp; get help from experienced ebay members. Maybe ask for a pic of the box/packaging &amp; advise the buyer that you have lodged a investigation with USPS or whoever.

As for the threatening voicemail, cant you report that to the police? Do not be bullied or intimidated into giving a refund. Whats his feedback like? Its hard to tell if hes lying, could have been stolen in transit? Who knows? but someone that threatens physical abuse generally indicates to me that they are lying (just my opinion though, I like to study peoples behaviour!)

Sorry I couldnt offer any help.I wish you the best of luck</ChosenAnswer>
