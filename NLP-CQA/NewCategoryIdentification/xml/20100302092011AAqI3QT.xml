    <Subject>Phone zoo? I just need some information?</Subject>
    <Content>Do pre-paid phones work with phone zoo? 
I&#039;ve never had a cell phone. I&#039;m seventeen but it really doesn&#039;t 
bother me. My mom just got her first pre paid phone and she decided it&#039;d be safe for me to have one. So that&#039;s all fine and dandy but I have people telling me when I get my phone to use phone zoo. 
Is it safe?
Can pre paid phones work with it? 
Is they&#039;re any cost to it?

    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s safe. There are no cost- it&#039;s completely free and works with all cell phones. You just have to have texting enabled on your phone so that the website can send you the ringtone or wallpaper or whatever you download.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Phone zoo is safe and it is free. As far as pre-paid phones working, you have to register your phone during the registration process, so you will find out that way whether your phone is one of the ones they accept.</Content>
