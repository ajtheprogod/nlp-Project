    <ChosenAnswer>The anti-snoring device works by keeping your lower jaw more or less closed that increase your airflow thus eliminating your snores.

I know some of my friends have tried this with some good results, let me know how it works for you if you try it.

How it works – Snoring research has shown that a jaw supporter, keeping the lower jaw in an upward position increases the three dimensional space in the airway, reduces air velocity and soft tissue vibration. This action can eliminate or substantially reduce snoring.

A jaw supporter is based on the same principle as CPR. The airway must be open to allow air to pass through the throat. A constricted or collapsed airway causes snoring and/or OSA. A jaw supporter can hold the lower jaw in a position so that it does not fall backwards/down during the night and cause the airway to collapse. Maintaining a clear airway improves breathing and reduces snoring.

            <Content>If you sleep on your side or stomach, that will cut down on snoring.  You could also use one of those nasal strips, but I have heard that those are uncomfortable.  Sometimes allergies or sinus problems also cause snoring.  I think they make throat spray that you can use right before bed that helps with it also.  Or take some sinus medicine, or use a vaporizer.</Content>

            <Content>Since you asked in the computer section, for shits and giggles, I&#039;ll tell you to take the tower of your pc and drop it on the head of the person who&#039;s snoring. If it&#039;s you than that becomes physically impossible in which case  I suggest that you take the first answer as best :)</Content>
