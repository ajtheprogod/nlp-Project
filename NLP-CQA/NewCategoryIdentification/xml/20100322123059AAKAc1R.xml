    <ChosenAnswer>It depends on what you wish to spend your swagbucks on. 

If you are looking to spend on amazon cards you will see the following conversions - 
For a 5$ Amazon Card 450 SwagBucks (1 dollar = 90 swagbucks)
For a 25$ Amazon Card 3150 SwagBucks (1 dollar = 126 swagbucks)
For a 50$ Amazon Card 5900 SwagBucks (1 dollar = 118 swagbucks)

If you are looking to spend on paypal you will see the following conversions - 
For a 5$ Paypal 550 SwagBucks (1 dollar = 110 swagbucks) **On Sale Price**
For a 5$ Paypal 900 SwagBucks (1 dollar = 180 swagbucks) **Regular Price**

As you can see the value of a dollar changes depending on the prize you look at. If the prize you want is not on the list I explained, you can find it by dividing the total cost in swagbucks by the dollar value of the item. If the dollar value is not listed, get on amazon.com and look up the value.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I guess it would equal 10 swagbucks 1 dollar.

Since before it was 1 swagbucks equals 1 dollar, but at that time you could only earn up to 1 swagbuck.</Content>
