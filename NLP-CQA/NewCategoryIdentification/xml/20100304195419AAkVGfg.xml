    <Subject>Internet Connection Clogging Up?</Subject>
    <Content>I am running Vista (Service pack 2) and run through wireless.  When i connect to the internet, everything is fine.  But then after say 10 mins - 1 hour, my internet connection slows down big time, to the point that when I go to load another page, it takes forever &amp; just seems to keep on tryng to connect.  The problem is always solved by restarting my computer.  I&#039;m positive that it&#039;s not the wireless connection, cause that&#039;s still connected.  I&#039;m figuring it could have something to do with my firewall (Zonealarm), but I not sure.  I run Avast &amp; Malwarebytes on my computer (both with real time protection), so I kinda don&#039;t think that I&#039;ve got a virus or that it&#039;s a spyware issue.  I clean regularly with (Avanced Sysytem Care) &amp; (CCleaner) as well.  Any help would be much appreciated.
