    <ChosenAnswer>LOL....500MB for a Fiver and you want to spend 5 hours a day on the internet ...you have no chance !!!

  Mobile Broadband is a rip off ....With most Mobile Broadband it comes with at least 1GB per month but be warned , go over that limit each month and it will end up costing you a pretty penny ...</ChosenAnswer>
