  <Question id="20100306103709AASuVJw" type="Answered">
    <Subject>formspring.me PLEASEEEE HELPPP!!!!!!!?</Subject>
    <Content>okay so i  have two questions:
1. i answered some questions and it&#039;s been like an hour and none of them have showed up on my profile and they&#039;re not in my inbox either. so what happened to them? is it just taking a while to show up? im positive i didn&#039;t delete any.
2. i heard about some people asking something anonymously on someone&#039;s formspring and later it showed who they were! i&#039;m freaking out. is that possible, or did they just forget to check &quot;say anonymously&quot; and then they thought they did?

thanks so much to anyone who answers!
