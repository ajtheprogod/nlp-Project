    <ChosenAnswer>some people mute sound on chat roulette. If you see that the audio is enabled on the other persons cam, then maybe it is a problem with the dell laptop.  another site like chat roulette is chat hopper.com try it on that site and see if u can hear the other person. it may be chat roulettes fault. that site is very laggy and crashes on me after only being on a few minutes. I will be in the middle of a chat with someone and it just freezes on me. too many people are on it I think and the servers can&#039;t handle it. u don&#039;t want on that site anyway. its mostly men masterbating it seems like. if your wanting to just do webcam chat try justin.tv  ustream.tv  blogtv.com  u can co host on them. well Im not sure about justin.tv but u can on the other ones</ChosenAnswer>
