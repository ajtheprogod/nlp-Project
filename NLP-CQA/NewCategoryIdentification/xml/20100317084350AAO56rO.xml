    <Subject>Why does Verizon DSL not offer promotional discounts to current customers?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m stuck paying 29.99 for 1Mbps and they have promotions like 14.99 for life for new customers. If i ask to get in on the deal or any others, they never allow it..Is there some trick I am missing?
