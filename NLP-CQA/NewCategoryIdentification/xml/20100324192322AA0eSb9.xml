    <Subject>Question about PayPal?</Subject>
    <Content>I deleted my PayPal account yesterday as I thought I didn&#039;t need one and now I need a new one! 
My question is why can&#039;t I add my card to this new account?

&#039;Before you can add this credit card to another account, you must contact the PayPal Credit Card Team at cardproblems@paypal.com. A Customer Service Representative will respond to your request shortly. If you would rather add a different credit card to your PayPal account, you may do so at any time. Thank you for your cooperation.&#039;

Why is this?
I would add another card - If I had one !!
