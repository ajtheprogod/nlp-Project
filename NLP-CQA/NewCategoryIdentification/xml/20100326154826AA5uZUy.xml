  <Question id="20100326154826AA5uZUy" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What are good picture-sharing websites for kids?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m ten years old, and I have a really professional camera. It can take focus pictures, it can edit pictures, so, that means it&#039;s totally awesome. I would really like picture-sharing websites that I can share professional-looking pictures on. I need a website that allows ten year-olds. Can you help me?

    <ChosenAnswer>While most photo-sharing sites will allow kids, a lot of creeps are on those sites as well. (By creeps, I mean people who take rather.. er.. non-child-friendly photos.)

I do generally wind up using photobucket, though. Nicer community than most of the other ones I&#039;ve tried.</ChosenAnswer>
