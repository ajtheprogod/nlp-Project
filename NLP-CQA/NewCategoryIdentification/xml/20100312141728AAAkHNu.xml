    <Subject>What&#039;s that one website that pays for referrals?</Subject>
    <Content>I remember a while ago I ran into a website who put together those who needed referrals with those who were willing to do them.  Does anyone know this website?  It&#039;s pretty well-known, I believe.  You create like a profile, and search for offers to do.  (It might start with a &quot;p&quot;?)

    <ChosenAnswer>It is called points2shop. But i say there is another better website than that called swagbucks. You might have heard of it. If you have not then just click on the link below or copy and paste the link in your address bar and then hit enter and find all the information on swagbucks. It is really a helpful and great site.
