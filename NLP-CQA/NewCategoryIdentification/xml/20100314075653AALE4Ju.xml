    <ChosenAnswer>You don&#039;t you get firefox.

Also, the problem you are describing is your CPU (Processor) overheating, nothing to do with internet explorer. The only reason you see a correlation between putting on IE and it shutting down is because you execute a process that requires continual processing bringing the temperature up until the safeguards put in place automatically power off the computer.

Your CPU Heatsink\fan may have come loose from the bracket or the bracket may be broken. Or it may be extremely dusty inside your computer.</ChosenAnswer>
