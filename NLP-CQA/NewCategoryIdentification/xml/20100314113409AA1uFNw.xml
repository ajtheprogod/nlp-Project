            <Content>Give yourself only so much recreational time per day - and stick to it. Set a timer for one or two hours and when it rings, stop playing and get to work. Time management is an art that must be adhered to else you will lose your way. Best of luck... And don&#039;t set the timer too near, else you may be tempted to shut it off and continue playing. Best wishes.</Content>

            <Content>Joe...
The Internet is NOT preventing you from a single damn thing !!
It is your own lack of control and focus that is preventing you from
doing what you should be doing....
If you have any kind of addiction... and, believe me... Internet can
definitely be an addiction... you have to approach it as such....
Find those things that are eating up your time and have your attentions
glued down and are causing you to loose yourself in the processes....
and... eliminate them.... period....
A person can not, in reality, blame the entity for their own lack of abilities
to control their involvement with it.....
