    <ChosenAnswer>Just so you know its very hard to get a prize from Lockerz. They only have a redemption about once a month that lasts for 30min. And you have no clue when itll happen. 

And just a suggestion- Look into signing up at swagbucks. You can can earn points to buy amazon gift cards and buy the ipod touch through amazon. Itll be much easier.  http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</ChosenAnswer>
