    <Subject>Can I get a refund for damaged items on eBay? (Specifically scratched disc)?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m considering buying a playstation 2 game on ebay, but it is only available used and it is very rare (and very expensive). I&#039;ve never used eBay before so I am wondering - what if I receive a scratched disc and cannot play through the game? Is the seller obligated to refund my payment?

            <Content>Fund the purchase through paypal, they cover you in the event of the item not being received or not as described. So if the seller describes it as in excellent used condition &amp;  you receive it to find that it is faulty paypal will refund you. However if it is described as faulty/stratched, you wont be refunded. 
Read the item listing carefully &amp; if you have any questions that are not answered in the listing ask the seller before placing a bid.</Content>
