    <Subject>Is anyone having AOL Email Problems?</Subject>
    <Content>Is anyone having problems with AOL Email?  So far they have lost my address book, pages fail to re-direct and emails get bounced for no good reason.  Normally it is fine but now seems to be very flakey.

    <ChosenAnswer>Yes lots of people are having trouble accessing AOL mail.  I use imap.aol.com on Outlook 2007 and it has been sporadic for two days.  The AOL mail blog states that they have been having problems.  I was able to access it with a POP account, but I don&#039;t want to do that.</ChosenAnswer>
