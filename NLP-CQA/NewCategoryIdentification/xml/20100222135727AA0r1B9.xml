I&#039;ve found some great stuff on this site. Stuff i&#039;d never normally listen to. I really enjoyed &quot;World War Z&quot; recently. It soudns a bit rubbish but is so well written and read by good actors.

He sometimes keeps moving, so its a good idea to subscribe to his RSS feed (Using google reader or something). Its also a lot, lot easier to browse what hes got posted up.</ChosenAnswer>
