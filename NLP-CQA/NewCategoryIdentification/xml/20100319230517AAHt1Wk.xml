            <Content>There should be an option that allows you to test your webcam settings. It might be called Audio/Video settings or something of the sort.

It shows you what your webcam is picking up!</Content>

            <Content>use a mirror lol

on on your computer you should have a program that runs your web cam don&#039;t know what kind you got so i can&#039;t help you much there

if you go into paint or yahoo messenger or msn you can open your web cam not talking to anyone and see your image and adjust the lighting and hair there.
if its logtech or Microsoft look for that in the programs 
otherwise thy paint and import image or yahoo messanger</Content>
