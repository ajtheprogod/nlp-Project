    <Subject>Selling broken items on E-bay?</Subject>
    <Content>I came across quite a strange seller, who&#039;s name was, sold_broken. Everything this seller sold was AS-IS. Lots of normally expensive stuff, marked way down. The thing is, I seen a buyer in the feedback, who&#039;d bought like 50+ AS-IS items, alot of the items were the the same things to. Is this some kind of scam or system?

    <ChosenAnswer>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re making a custom device for tracking commercial trucks, and your design uses a certain cell phone to save engineering effort.  But you don&#039;t need the whole phone, just the circuit board with the main chips and transceiver.  Instead of spending $100 to buy a new cell phone with intact speaker, mic, LCD, keyboard, etc., you buy broken ones off eBay whenever they show up for $10, and probably 4 out of 5 work out for you.

After you get done with the parts you need from the phones, maybe 20% will have working screens and keyboards left over.  You put them up for sale on eBay and some guy who repairs phones for a living will snap them right up.

That&#039;s one of the (few) great reasons to use eBay -- your junk is literally someone else&#039;s treasure.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Most of these buyers are buying the for parts or think they can fix them.

So no, they are not scams.

Sometimes I look for broken laptops cause I need a few parts from them.</Content>

            <Content>This is probably not a scam. Some people buy in bulk and get feedback on each item. That&#039;s why you see multiples of the same feedback. Plus, Ebay is VERY good at catching spammers.</Content>
