    <ChosenAnswer>Did you use &quot;disk cleanup&quot; as well? It gets rid of old unused space, but to answer your antivirus program question, I recommend AVG free version and/or Spybot they are both free and good, but also get rid of programs you don&#039;t need. Too much space used slows down the computer because it may take too long to search for what you want.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>AVG is free for personal use. I&#039;ve never used it but I hear from other people that it&#039;s good. Also, my old high school from 5 years ago used it while I was there.</Content>

            <Content>I use Avast as an anti virus program (the only thing I don&#039;t like about it is if I have the volume on and there is an update, it will loudly tell you so, lol.) but it&#039;s a great, free, effective program. I also use Spybot as a malware/spyware removal. You should look into getting that too, it&#039;s free as well. When my computer is lagging a little more than normal I usually do a scan with the Spybot. It helps more than what you realize, and also deletes temporary files which helps speed things up a bit.
