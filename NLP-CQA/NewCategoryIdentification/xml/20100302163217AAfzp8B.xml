    <Subject>Did I lose my money on paypal, What does processing mean..?</Subject>
    <Content>I sold something on ebay and the money went straight to paypal. I then pressed withdraw + then add transfer to bank account and it said it was pending for 1 day, and then it finally said completed. So I then checked my internet banking and the money did not show up. So I went to paypal and pressed add funds from bank account so the money went back. It now says processing, Have I lost my money? When will it be there? Pleaseeeeeeeee help I&#039;m so worried I lost my money!!!!!!!!!! :( What does processing mean? It says the money will be in the bank on the 11th, Wow that&#039;s long. Has this ever happened to you? ah I&#039;m so stupid!
