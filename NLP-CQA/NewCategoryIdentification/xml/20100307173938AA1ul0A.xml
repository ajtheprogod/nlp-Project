  <Question id="20100307173938AA1ul0A" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What do I do? This eBay seller isn&#039;t responding!?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay so I bought a 15 gallon aquarium and filter for my betta fish and mollies off of eBay, and I haven&#039;t received it yet. It&#039;s been about 2 weeks now. I sent him a message about it, and he hasn&#039;t responded. He hasn&#039;t sold much on eBay before, so I guess he just doesn&#039;t check it. But how am I supposed to know what to do?!?! I don;t want to get eBay involved yet, do I keep waiting or what?

    <ChosenAnswer>No if you want your money back you get E-bay involved. You simply open a dispute with the seller within the Ebay specifed timeframe, then ebay will communate/middle man for you to work for dispute, claim item not recieved and you will get your money back from ebay upon resolution of the case.

Also, if you paid my Paypal, you are protected by them as well. File a dispute with Paypal also, as paypal - ebay = same company, likely to get money back quicker through paypal.</ChosenAnswer>
