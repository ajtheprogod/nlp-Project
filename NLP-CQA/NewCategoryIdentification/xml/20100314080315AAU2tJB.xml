    <ChosenAnswer>SMS Error 107 is a general purpose error.
In human language it means &quot;Could not send text within the set time&quot;.

Try changing the timeout of your SMS messages if you have that under settings, make sure you are using the full telephone number and try sending short texts (only a couple of words) to test which one might be the problem.

If this persists then take the phone back to Virgin Media as it may have been flashed wrong before being released for sale/contract to the public.</ChosenAnswer>
