    <Subject>Lockerz Help and free invites.?</Subject>
    <Content>Can someone explain how I can know about the date and time when to redeem my prize on lockerz.  Also this months redemption says it&#039;s only for the winners. So others cannot redeem prizes at all?

For those who would like a free invite to lockerz.com simply write your email address. 

Thanks
To clarify lockerz is free but invite only so I can provide you guys with an invite
