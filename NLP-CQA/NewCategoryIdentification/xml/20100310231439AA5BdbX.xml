            <Content>The &quot;best&quot; browser is a matter of preference and isn&#039;t the same for everyone. I like Firefox because there are a lot of extensions available for it and it&#039;s very customisable. For example, get the Adblock Plus extension and you won&#039;t see ads while browsing. I use maybe half a dozen add-ons and I can&#039;t imagine not having them. 

Google Chrome is supposedly faster than Firefox, it might be worth a try.  You know you can install multiple browsers and just see which you like?</Content>

            <Content>You&#039;re not going to get a straight answer if you ask this. It&#039;s best to give them all a test run to see what you like most. In my opinion, you should pick one of the more popular ones (IE8, Opera, Firefox, Chrome and Safari) as most websites don&#039;t support anything outside that and may cause some weird results.

Personally, I&#039;ve noticed that IE has more unreliable and slow downloads than Firefox, and is probably the least customizable of the lot there.

BTW, I&#039;m a Firefox guy.</Content>

            <Content>The main competition is between Firefox and Safari 4.0 and Google chrome. I would prefer Safari, because after the worst version of Safari 3.0, Apple has bought out a marvelous version of 4.0. 
Firefox for toolbar, speed and security
Safari for looks, speed, security and downloads.
Google chrome for all the above,,,,,,, but I would prefer Safari.</Content>
