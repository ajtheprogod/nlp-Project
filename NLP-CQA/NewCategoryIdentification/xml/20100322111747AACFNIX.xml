    <ChosenAnswer>In theory everywhere could have internet but in very isolated places it would be very costly - by satellite. Also you would need electricity. In mountainous regions there might be no cell phone service either.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>There are several places in the world that do not have a good enough instraucture for DSL/Cable/Fiber optic.

However I don&#039;t think its possible to go to places that doesn&#039;t have internet connection, there is always the option to use Dial-up (connects through phone lines), mobile broadband (connections through radio waves), and satellites (self-explanatory)</Content>
