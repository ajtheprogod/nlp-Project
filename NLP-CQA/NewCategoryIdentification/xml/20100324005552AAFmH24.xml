  <Question id="20100324005552AAFmH24" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Need an active, decent sized forum community to post with?</Subject>
    <Content>Tonight, I went to an old Halo(the video game) Podcasting website that I used to post on when I was 15.. I&#039;m now 18. 

I had over 1000 posts there and looking through them tonight, I got very nostalgic and missed the feeling of posting with a nice and active forum community where everyone knew each other..

If anyone has any cool forums they know of(or post on themselves), that would be awesome. I was really into Halo when I posted on those forums, but now I play WoW. I&#039;d prefer the main topic of the forum to be video game based, but any suggestions in general would be nice.

Thank you very much!

    <ChosenAnswer>If you are 16, then you are about to get a car I would imagine. I always like car forums, so if you want to get a Honda, then start browsing and posting in Honda sites, even some geared particularly to what model you want or are going to get.

I always like to look at different customizations/mods, and performance ideas. Plus you meet others in you area and can buy used parts.</ChosenAnswer>
