    <Subject>Is Dyscern a scam? Has anyone else dealt with Dyscern?</Subject>
    <Content>Dyscern (http://www.dyscern.com/) sells used/refurbished electronics. I made a mistake and ordered from there website without reading any reviews or researching on the company. I have read that they send out &quot;ghost&quot; UPS tracking devices without actually sending anything out at all.. Has anyone else bought anything at Dyscern?

            <Content>Hi Alexander,

I will quickly tell you that I am not an unbiased responder as I work for Dyscern.  Not to worry, we are are a real company. While we aren&#039;t perfect, we do stand by our products with a 30 day warranty.  I have sourced our Google shopping reviews below.  They aren&#039;t perfect (we deal in used and refurbished items making misunderstandings a far more likely) but they are decent.  One thing you won&#039;t find in any of them is a complaint that we took a customers money and didn&#039;t send them an item.  I hope you like your item!
