  <Question id="20100325221339AAL5hLf" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I&#039;m trying to do a complete site-rip of sites like icanhascheezburger...?</Subject>
    <Content>I found a tool called downthemall which will download the images from the page, the problem is that there are 661 pages, is there any way I can add all pages simultaneously or do I have to go through manually...

thanks!
I meant rip all images, not in the strictest sense a site-rip, but more of just ripping all images from the site. maybe a spider program that will go through every page on the site and downloading all jpg images.
I&#039;ve downloaded 10 page&#039;s worth already and it&#039;s 3.3 MB. so, for 661 pages it&#039;ll probably be about 218 MB, so not much at all mr. negative
