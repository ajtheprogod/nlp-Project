Try to sell your bike on B2C/B2B/C2C sites like: http://ww w.ebay,com, http://amazon,com and http://www.topbuysell.com . If i were u, i would try all 3 to increase my traffic to the max and make more people know them. You may search more such sites to promote your products.  Good luck</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Try Kijiji! I&#039;ve had a lot of success selling things on there, and you can sell it to someone nearby who can pick it up, or you can bring it to them.</Content>
