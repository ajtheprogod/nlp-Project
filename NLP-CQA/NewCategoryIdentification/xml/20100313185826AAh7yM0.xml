    <ChosenAnswer>Well: (lol)

I don&#039;t have a Mac but I&#039;ve been reading some stuff and (if you haven&#039;t already figured it out) you could try disabling the RSS updates feature in Safari -- (Safari)/(Preferences)/ click on the RSS tab and change (Check for updates:) to (Never)

OR I think it has helped some people to delete certain sites from their Top Sites list (i.e. Google Reader), or from their history or bookmarks list.

Hope this helps???
