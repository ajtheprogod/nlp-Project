            <Content>Try clicking on the following link, sweetheart ... and I offer that as a general term of endearment.  It is NOT intended to be offensive, obnoxious, condescending, or sexist ... though, I must admit, I have yet to use it to an adult male, apart from my own two grown up sons and one of their friends who I&#039;ve unofficially &#039;adopted&#039;.  It works for me on both Mozilla Firefox 3.6 and Internet Explorer 8.</Content>

&quot;Thank you for your email. There is currently a small fault with the website, due a huge influx of users trying to sign in at once – well over 86,000. Our technical team is already working on the problem and the World Maths Day website will be back up and running very very soon.&quot;</Content>

            <Content>We are in the US (almost 11am) and are experiencing the same problem. The sign in button is grey and nothing happens when it is clicked. Thanks for posting the question, at least we can surmise that the problem is not with our computer system, but with the website.</Content>

            <Content>I can&#039;t sign in either. My guess is there&#039;s a problem their end with their clock, so that some part of the system thinks the day is over. The UK support line is engaged, so I suspect they know about it and and working on a fix.</Content>

Dear Students, Teachers and Parents,

2 hours ago the World Maths Day website experienced a sustained outage, and since that time, users have been unable to participate intermittently.

We are working as quickly as possible to rectify the issue – restoring the event to full operation.

All participants will retain all their points earned prior to the outage. The Halls of Fame will be updated accordingly. In addition, we will extend the event by the period of the outage, so that everyone has the opportunity to participate fully.

We unreservedly apologise for the inconvenience, and look forward to recommencing the full operation of the event as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely,

Any problem accessing the reports after your students finish?  I normally use VMath as my curriculum, and when going in as I normally do, the site says my students haven&#039;t participated yet, and shows a score of 0.  They are going to be really disappointed if I can&#039;t fix this!</Content>
