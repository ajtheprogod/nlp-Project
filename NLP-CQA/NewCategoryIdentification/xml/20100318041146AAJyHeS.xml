  <Question id="20100318041146AAJyHeS" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I delete anything and everything dirty from my computer?</Subject>
    <Content>Or at least try? I&#039;m a teen and I really don&#039;t need this bs anymore, I have more important things I should be doing instead and i&#039;m becoming addicted. Besides, this laptop is used by my nosey mom too. 

I feel guilty for letting it take up so much of my time. I want to get rid of every trace possible.

Help?

            <Content>The best (and easiest to use) tool I have found for cleaning up your computer and securely removing deleted material is East Tec Eraser.


They have a 15 day trial version, which is fully functional, so if you just want to do this as a one-off, this is the tool to use.

www.easttec.com

This tool will also allow you to securely delete files or folders you select.


Note to Firzen - formatting the hard drive does NOT remove the data - trust me, I get paid to recover data from formatted and f-disked hard drives all the time - I&#039;m very good at it!</Content>
