    <ChosenAnswer>well, did you e-mail the message?

As far as ff.net errors go, I usually find they resolve themselves within a few days (that doesn&#039;t mean that people aren&#039;t fixing them, I just don&#039;t know) If it doesn&#039;t, send the message again. And maybe again. You could try writing a full out e-mail to them.


Good Luck! (you might need it)</ChosenAnswer>
