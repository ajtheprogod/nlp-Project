    <Subject>Is Pay-pal supposed to Charge me?</Subject>
    <Content>I have sold an item on ebay and have already been charged 2 seperate fees by them.
When I tried to claim my money, paypal have took there own fee out?
if I refund the item to the buyer will I avoid all these charges as I am not willing to pay 3 fees just to sell 1 item?

    <ChosenAnswer>Yes you will be charged a fee when you receive money, many on if they are using pay pal will add those fees in the cost of the merchandise being sold so that is pushed on your customer. This is done all the time, so it not something unheard of.
