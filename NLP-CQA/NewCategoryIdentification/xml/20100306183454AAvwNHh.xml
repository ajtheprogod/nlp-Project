            <Content>There are two ways of making a Website. You can use (W)hat (Y)ou (S)ee (I)s (W)hat (Y)ou (G)et. Freewebs is a example of that.

Or you can code it. Coding gives you much more control over how your website looks.

Everything you need is already on your computer. A Web Browser. A text editor. And some time.

Here are some beginner links to learn how to make websites:

http://www.w3schools.com/html/ (To learn HTML)

http://w3schools.com/css/default.asp (To learn CSS)


A useful useful site to learn about how to put your website on the Internet is:

http://www.2createawebsite.com/


Also, If you don&#039;t want to learn to code. But want more then just Freewebs. Try one of these:

http://kompozer.net/download.php

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/



Hope this helps.</Content>
