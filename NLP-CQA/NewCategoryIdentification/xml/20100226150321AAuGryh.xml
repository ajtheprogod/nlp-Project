  <Question id="20100226150321AAuGryh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Suddenly I can&#039;t log into my AIM account anywhere?</Subject>
    <Content>I use the latest version of iChat when I use AIM, and it was working just fine last night, and suddenly, I&#039;m getting an error that my username/password is incorrect and unrecognized on iChat, Mail, AIM.com, AOL, etc. I&#039;m absolutely positive no one hacked into my account, either. All my other accounts work just fine. What&#039;s going on?
Okay, okay, I get it.
And I did search before posting. All the topics were from 2-4 years ago, so I assumed it was just me.

            <Content>Yeah, everyone seems to be reporting problems with AIM right now. If you&#039;d actually searched, you&#039;d know that.</Content>
            <Reference>Mine works fine, so everyone else&#039;s hosting server must suck.</Reference>

            <Content>it&#039;s happening to everyone else with an aol/aim screenname, aol is probably updating it&#039;s site or having technical difficulties, i&#039;m sure it will be solved shortly you&#039;ll just have to wait it out.</Content>

            <Content>It has to be a problem with aim, because you just posted this question 6 minutes ago, and aim is doing the exact same thing with me. I guess we&#039;ll just have to wait for somebody somewhere to fix aim.</Content>

            <Content>I&#039;m having the same exact problem. I tried my account on my iPod and the computer and it still didn&#039;t work. I even deleted my AIM app and got a new one, but still the same thing is happening. I researched on the Internet and it said alot of people were also having trouble. One source said that AOL was probably having connection issues and in a few hours the accounts would be back.</Content>
