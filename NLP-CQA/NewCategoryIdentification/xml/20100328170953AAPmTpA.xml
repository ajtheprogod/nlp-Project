    <Subject>How do I restore previous websites in the address bar--FIREFOX?</Subject>
    <Content>I don&#039;t know what happened but I can&#039;t see the previous websites I&#039;ve typed into the address bar anymore.  It&#039;s kind of annoying to type in the whole address again without having it pop up automatically.  How do i fix this?  Thanks.
