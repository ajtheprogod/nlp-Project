    <ChosenAnswer>It is your internet, it cannot sustain a chat/cam with a foreign server for over 10 mins. This is probably due to speed, location, quota or even your firewall.

Most of these can be fixed easily. Some cant though

            <Content>Are you sure it&#039;s your computer, as it may be the chatroulette server crashing. Also what browser are you using? Try switching to firefox or chrome as there may be a memory leak in the browser.</Content>
