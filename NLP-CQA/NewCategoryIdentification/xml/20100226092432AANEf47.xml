    <Subject>How do I add more than one contact to outgoing email in Mozilla Thunderbird?</Subject>
    <Content>I can&#039;t figure out how to add more than one contact to an outgoing email. I have tried using the cc button. I can add one person but no more. I have tried putting a semi colon and typing another name but autocomplete won&#039;t finish it. Help Please!
I tried the comma and the drop down menu. The drop down didn&#039;t open a new line.  It didn&#039;t work.  Thanks for trying though.......anybody else have any ideas?

    <ChosenAnswer>just separate email addresses by a coma. Also you can go to the column below the first one, select &quot;To&quot; from the drop-down menu, type the address, then add another column, etc. But separating addresses by &quot;,&quot; is your best bet.</ChosenAnswer>
