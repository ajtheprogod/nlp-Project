  <Question id="20100307211154AAhfIBg" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I have a Tumblr question?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay, well I&#039;ve been reading this girl&#039;s tumblr posts for a while now because I think they&#039;re interesting, but we don&#039;t really know each other and I&#039;d prefer to keep it that way. So, I was wondering if there was a way this girl could find out that I&#039;ve been looking at here Tumblr account even though I myself don&#039;t have one? Can she track me down somehow?
