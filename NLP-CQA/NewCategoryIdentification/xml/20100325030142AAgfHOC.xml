            <Content>Looks like one person is suggesting you contact them and they&#039;ll send/sell you a copy, and one is suggesting you use torrent.

Either way, that&#039;s breaking the law (not to mention using a torrent opens YOU up to 1) acting as a server distributing illegal software and 2) whatever you download could contain viruses, trojans and other bad things you don&#039;t want!

Software theft costs software companies over $53 BILLION a year in lost revenue (link provided below). Downloading and using pirated software costs not only the company, but real live people you&#039;ll never meet. By not paying, the company can&#039;t hire developers - so pirated software means higher unemployment, which means people have less money to spend in the economy, which means less employment, which... well, you get the idea.

Besides: would stealing software make your mother proud? Is stealing software teaching your children how they should act? Would a company hiring you want a thief for an employee?

We won&#039;t talk about Supreme Beings and how they would view stealing. Eh?

I
ve also added a link to the RIAA concerning the estimated 71,000 jobs lost because of illegal music downloads, and the $12.5 BILLION it&#039;s costing music companies.

Theft is stealing. Don&#039;t do it!</Content>
