    <ChosenAnswer>Lois, I have to say that &quot;explanation&quot; sounds a bit fishy to me.  If Gifworks has been closed, why does the link not send us to a page that tells us this instead of sending us to Clipart.com, which gives no explanation about Gifworks at all?

Dorothy, there&#039;s another online editor here: http://www.online-image-editor.com/ that you might like to try but I don&#039;t like it as much as Gifworks.

There&#039;s also an early version of Ulead Gif Animator that you can download for free.
It&#039;s here: http://encoderx.co.uk/imageeditors/index.php

To download it, click on the text link that says Ulead Gif Animator, NOT on the picture below it.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I was just informed that GifWorks was shut down. Someone over at AnimationFactory.com just told me that they are unable to provide technical support or suggestions for editing files. You&#039;ll need to find another program to edit GIFs.</Content>
