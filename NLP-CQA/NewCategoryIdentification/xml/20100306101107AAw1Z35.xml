    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s blocked for me, too. It could be that one of the advertisments on the site (pop-ups etc.) is malicious (gives you a virus or other malware). This could be the fault of the zomg&#039;s advertising provider, rather than the site itself, hence the link with other video sites in the diagnostic page. Apparently the site admins are &quot;working on it.&quot;

You can ignore the warning, and Adblock and/or your antivirus /might/ block the offending content (if it does come up).

            <Content>That is strange. Firefox is giving me the same message. I was watching anime this morning, but there was no warning. Something must have happened between this morning and this afternoon that compromised the site and infected it with a virus.</Content>
