  <Question id="20100328124716AAAjSMV" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I open up my Limited PayPal-account?</Subject>
    <Content>6 months ago, PayPal limited my account, so that I couldn&#039;t send money.
I have tried scanning my bank-account and my passport, but the still don&#039;t open the account.

There was a system message from them saying that they thought there were unauthorised access to my account, but there really isn&#039;t.

So how do I open my account again?

It&#039;s really annoying cause there&#039;s loads of stuff I wanna buy on Ebay, but I really can&#039;t without PayPal.

    <ChosenAnswer>Are you sure they did, this sounds like one of the spam emails I get quite regularly. Have you actually tried logging into your account and seeing what is going on? 

You just need to ring them, the number is in their help section. I&#039;ve contacted them on the phone a couple of times about various problems and they usually sort it quite quickly.  If they do limit your account they send a code to your bank account and you have to check your online (or paper) bank statement and email this code back to them if i remember rightly. I vageuly remember sending a scan of a household bill with my address but I could be wrong it was a few years ago this happened.</ChosenAnswer>
