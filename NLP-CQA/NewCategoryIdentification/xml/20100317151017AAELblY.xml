    <Subject>Firfox browser will not open/start/launch/anything/etc.?</Subject>
    <Content>My computer was recently been infected with one of those fake firewall things, like Personell Security,etc. I got hit by Vista Smart Security, which is a virus. So I got rid of that, and did a scan with avg, and did everything, etc. And so when I go to run firefox, it own&#039;t start. I double click it, and I get about a 1-2 second of the little blue laoding circle on vistas, an then nothing. I tried to open it in safe mode, and still nothing. I tried renaming the exe file, still nothing, and I can&#039;t creat new profiles because when I try, I get the window thing at the bottom, but nothing pops up. Im using IE right now, and I don&#039;t know why this wasn&#039;t affected and firefox is. I don/t want to uninstall and reinstall, I don&#039;t even think I can, because anything that has to do with firefox won&#039;t open. 
If any can help, well...please help
thanks

            <Content>Try scanning alternatively with Spyware Doctor or other anti-spyware, because this rogue can be still hiding on your PC and blocks the Internet for you.</Content>
