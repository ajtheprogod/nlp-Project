    <Subject>wihout my consent how experts exchange can take the amounts?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi All

Last year in the month ie jan 2009  i subscribed to experts-exchange.com
services by making an online payment option with my friends credit card
with a subscription around 2200 indian rupees.which is for a period of 6 month.
After that i did not request for any renewal of their services.

Today i got a shocking  news !

JAN2010 amount 2200 indian rupees has been deducted from my friends
Bank account through his credit card,for which he has received a message 
from HDFC saying that the amount 2200 has been debited from his Savings Bank account
for renewal of expert-exchange.com services.

How this can happen ? wihout my consent how experts exchange can take the amount.

How to report this matter to whom ?

If i write to expertsexchange it will go in vain, since their response is very poor.

Am confused kindly suggest .

    <ChosenAnswer>It is not uncommon for subscription-based websites to have recurring fees (e.g., Netflix, Gamfly, etc). Magazines and newspapers have been doing this for decades prior to websites. It is legal practice in the United States.</ChosenAnswer>
