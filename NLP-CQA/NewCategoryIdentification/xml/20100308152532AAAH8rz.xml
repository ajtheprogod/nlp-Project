    <Subject>computer issues/verizon or not sure help please?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m thinking cookies or something like that need cleaned out of the browser or whatever, because the connection is slow and sometimes does not connect at all. I am not sure if this is a problem with Verizon&#039;s modem or what but I need some assistance. The operating system on this laptop is Windows 7 and I do not know how to mess with the browser in Google Chrome. Firefox has stopped working for us. Can someone help me out with my computer issues?
