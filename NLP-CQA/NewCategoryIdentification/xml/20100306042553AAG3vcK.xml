  <Question id="20100306042553AAG3vcK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why are young people so selfish on the web?</Subject>
    <Content>In the real world - and also on the web - people creating something to sell rely on the money from sales of that current item to have money to create the next item.  If you run a lemonade stand and allow people to take your lemonade for free, you will have no money to make more lemonade.  It&#039;s so simple.
So why are there so many posts on here from people whose trial version of software have finished, wanting to know how to either &quot;crack&quot; the software or download a full version for free?
Don&#039;t the people doing this realize they are thieves, or do they have the idea that doing it on the web (as opposed to taking something off the shelf in a store) somehow makes it okay?
Perhaps those indulging in this dishonest activity should imagine a crowd of total strangers around their lemonade stand, simply taking away their lemonade for free.

            <Content>And yet, good products can be made without asking your users to pay for them.
Millions of people downloading and using the lemonade and there&#039;s still some left.

            <Content>Yep...couldn&#039;t agree with you more!  Sometimes they come up with lame explanations like &quot;I have a legitmate copy of Office but I lost the key&quot;.    This has always annoyed me too.  Maybe Yahoo Answers needs to monitor their boards a little better and delete those types of questions (at a minimum) or cancel their Yahoo Answers accounts.</Content>

            <Content>IMO this is all moral bs. Life is about survival of the fittest: you take what&#039;s yours and you steal what&#039;s not. If you really want to live in a fair world, I suggest you first begin working on eliminating poverty and disease. If you can&#039;t do that, you&#039;re just as selfish as the ones stealing off your lemonade.

BTW, if thieving weren&#039;t considered illegal/immoral, would we honestly care about whether we&#039;ve earned the stuff we have? Have you earned every single thing you own? What about expecting presents, isn&#039;t that just a more &quot;civilised&quot; form of theft? Honestly, you should stop complaining and other people should stop pretending they care. If you don&#039;t want your lemonades stolen, find a way to keep it safe.</Content>
