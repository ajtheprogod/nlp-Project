  <Question id="20100319150113AAh58Zy" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I just bought a Domain. Now, what?</Subject>
    <Content>So, I just bought a domain.

Where can I get hosting for the cheapest? Are there any free hosts for purchased domains that are actually good?
Any personal experience would be nice. What do you prefer?

I have Googled but I&#039;m overwhelmed by all the options. I&#039;m asking what people prefer and what they trust best.

Also, whatever is the best for the least money. I&#039;m poor. =P

    <ChosenAnswer>I recommend one of these: http://www.tophostingpicks.com

iPage has the best offer right now.
Their standard price is $84/year ($6.95) but they have
a 50% sale, one year of hosting for $42.00.

Their plan includes:

Unlimited disk space
Unlimited bandwidth
Free domain name

Price: $42/year ($3.50)

They have one of the most popular hosting platforms, which currently hosts over a million websites. They&#039;re also one of the oldest hosting companies, founded in 1998.

They include a free point &amp; click online site builder so you can create a website without any programming (easily, just by drag and drop) or you could install Wordpress (they include easy, one click install from their control panel), choose a theme that you like, and start adding content.

They also have a great custom control panel with OneClick installs of all the popular software like Wordpress, Joomla, Forums, Chat, Galleries, Online stores and a lot more.

P.S. Since you already have a domain name, you can use your free domain name to register another domain and create two websites and host them on the same account (at no additional cost).</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>There are a lot of web hosting options. A quick google search gives you this:

http://www.google.com/search?q=web+hosting&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a

Godaddy is a popular option, as well as HostGator.

Free hosting sites are sketchy, and should generally be avoided.</Content>
