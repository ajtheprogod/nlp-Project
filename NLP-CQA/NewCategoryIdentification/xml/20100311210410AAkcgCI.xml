    <Subject>When can you redeem your PTZ on Lockerz?</Subject>
    <Content>I was just wondering when Lockerz PTZ are redeemable. I want to know when I get enough PTZ to get an iTouch, how to get it. I hear there&#039;s some kind of thing where you can redeem your PTZ for a day. But when will that be? Tell me how to view when the redemption day thing is, and when this months will take place. Thanks.

    <ChosenAnswer>Technically lockerz doesn&#039;t really work. I have over 1500 ptz and every time they send out the email for redeem all the items get out of stock within 5 seconds. Basically to redeem you have to wait until the day is abd if you have luck you can get in. Beware on that day their site will be so laggy you can&#039;t redeem anything since they don&#039;t have the money to get better servers and that is why it is causing most users to leave after horrible redemptions.</ChosenAnswer>
