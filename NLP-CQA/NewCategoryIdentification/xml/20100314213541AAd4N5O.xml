    <Subject>Do you have to pay to use AOL?</Subject>
    <Content>If you do then why would people? I mean obviously you have to pay for internet service too or is AOL an internet service? I have never had it but once and it was a free trial. I still had to pay for my other internet through my cable company and then after the free trial I would have had to pay AOL too? Why is that?

            <Content>There are two parts to AOL. There&#039;s AOL the dial-up internet service provider, which you pay for, and there&#039;s AOL the online content provider, which you don&#039;t.</Content>
