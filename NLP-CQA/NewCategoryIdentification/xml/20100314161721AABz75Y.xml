The only site I know of that comes to close to what you&#039;re seeking is NADA Guides site. This site has a couple features that may help you. One feature lets you compare up to four cars side by side. So if you have some idea of what your looking for, this could help you narrow things down. The other helpful feature is their &quot;Build Your Own Car&quot;. Both features can be found under the &quot;Car Research Center&quot; heading on site.</ChosenAnswer>
