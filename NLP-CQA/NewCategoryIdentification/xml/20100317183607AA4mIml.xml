    <ChosenAnswer>Every pro has a con so just think of the opposite.

When the pro says the internet is good for knowledge then the con is the internet is bad for a load of crap!

Who at the end of the day who decides or defines what is good and what is bad? You do as an individual.

Mention the word porn and some people will throw their arms up in the air and go all hysterical over it and others couldn&#039;t give a toss one way or the other and some relish in it!

As for reporting it you are totally wasting your time even trying. No one body polices it.

What you have got to remember what is an offence in one country may not be in another. Most crap comes from countries who have no laws covering the internet anyway and there are no International Boundaries when it come to the internet.

As some one once said, if you are that offended over the internet then don&#039;t use it.</ChosenAnswer>
