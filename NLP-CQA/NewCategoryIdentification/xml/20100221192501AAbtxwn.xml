  <Question id="20100221192501AAbtxwn" type="Answered">
    <Subject>This is more so a Announcement to All Torrenters (DEMONOID)?</Subject>
    <Content>Demonoid.com is now Open Registration for all. 

i&#039;ve noticed for the past 3 days Demonoid has been Open Registration.

Demonoid is a First and Foremost Virus Free Torrenting site

Originally an invite only. but apparently they&#039;re trying to expand the site so its open to all, 

You get your own ratio. 

Later when they close it individual users will get Invitation codes you can give out to your friends, if your friend uploads a virus not only do they get banned but you can as well, this keeps the site safe from viruses

there is no porn, Viruses, or flaming of the uploaders



well yea i&#039;ve said enough Best torrenting site to date, Register
