  <Question id="20100311223921AAlZLZE" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does anyone have any tips for a date online?</Subject>
    <Content>My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months, but it&#039;s strictly been an online thing because I live in America and he lives in New Zealand. I have yahoo messenger on my phone, and that&#039;s normally how we talk every day, all day. We text and call also, but that gets expensive. I just got a laptop, and he suggested that we try to have &quot;dates&quot;

We use the webcam so we can see each other during these &quot;dates&quot;. So far, we&#039;ve watched the same movie at the same time, ate together, and played strip poker together on facebook poker lol. Does anyone have any more suggestions of what we can do? (and no dirty stuff, we have that covered!)
he is a real boyfriend, thanks ;) were meeting up in june :)
