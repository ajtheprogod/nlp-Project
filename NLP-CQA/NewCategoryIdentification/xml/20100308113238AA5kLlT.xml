    <ChosenAnswer>Depends who the seller is and if they offer &quot;SuperSaver Shipping&quot; on your items.  Here in the US, when purchasing books, if they say &#039;Supersaver eligable&quot; or something similar, you can combine the items into one or multiple shipments which will adjust the overall cost of shipping.  If the items come from different sellers and they do not state they give any form of reduces shipping for buying multiple items you should assume you will be paying shipping on both items seperately unfortunately.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I have only used Amazon a few times and I think you can choose whether or not you want items shipped together, but I&#039;m not 100%, what you can do though if you&#039;re not sure is proceed to the checkout and will show you the total bill including postage and packing before you actually pay for the items, then you will know for definite. hope I&#039;ve helped sort of lol x</Content>
