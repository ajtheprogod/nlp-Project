    <ChosenAnswer>Probably it happens due to Overheating of the Modem. If your internet connection is old, it could be probably because your modem cannot handle the large amount of data from videos. The Kaspersky version is also old. Better Upgrade to the latest version and turn off your firewall while browsing. For smooth watching of videos, install SPEEDBIT VIDEO ACCELERATOR from http://www.speedbit.com/</ChosenAnswer>
