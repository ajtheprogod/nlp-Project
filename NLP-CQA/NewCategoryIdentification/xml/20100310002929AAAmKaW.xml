    <ChosenAnswer>Hi,

It is very difficult to get the plan that you require.

I can suggest you to go for Hathway Internet, plan name Expressway - 1024 which has a speed of 1 MBPS and download limit of 1 GB per month.

And all this comes at only the cost of Rs. 275 per month.

Check out the plan from http://www.hathway.com/brodband/prod_broadband_packages.asp

And they also have many other customer plans which can be available if you contact them.

You can either contact your Cable guy who provides Hathway or visit their website www.hathway.com for more details.</ChosenAnswer>
