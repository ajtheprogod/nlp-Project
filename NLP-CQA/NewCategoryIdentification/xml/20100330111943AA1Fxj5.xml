  <Question id="20100330111943AA1Fxj5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Websites telling me I need Firefox 3.0+...But I have 3.6?</Subject>
    <Content>Numerous websites I go to keep giving me warnings like this:

But I&#039;ve downloaded Firefox 3.6 over and over again, and before 3.6 came out I still had the latest version, I always download when there&#039;s an update. But now it&#039;s saying I have an older version? I don&#039;t understand. Also, when I go to my Help--&gt;About Mozilla Firefox I get:

Saying that I have 3.6?
I don&#039;t understand, what am I doing wrong?

-I don&#039;t want to switch browsers, I really prefer firefox.
-I&#039;ve uninstalled and reinstalled - No help
-I&#039;ve gone to the site and tried to update manually, still no luck
-Tried the alternate shortcut-Nothing
-No Updates Available
-Bitdefender- No Infections found
:(
-I&#039;ve always downloaded it from the Mozilla site

Thank you for the tips so far

    <ChosenAnswer>when Firefox is saying that you got latest , then it is latest one for sure )) *grins*

or another possible thing could be that the shortcut link on desktop you have got is pointing to old version firefox&#039;s folder. the new version should have the shortcut here:

C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

also try to update it via : Firefox&#039;s Help menu &gt;&gt;Check for updates . 

or might be you&#039;re infected by any botnet or virus.

2.Now go to program files : C:\Program Files\

3. Go to C:\Documents and Settings\[YOUR_USER_NAME]\Application Data\
and
C:\Documents and Settings\[YOUR_USER_NAME]\Local Settings\Application Data
and delete the Mozilla folder.

4.Download the firefox from the given links:
http://hyperion.zih.tu-dresden.de/moz/firefox/releases/3.6.3/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%203.6.3.exe 

http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.6.3&amp;os=win〈=en-US
