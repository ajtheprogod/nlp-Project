            <Content>Have had this happen before to me. The virus simply messes up your file association. Please only use this site if you have win xp. It fixes file associations which sounds like it is an issue for you here. http://www.dougknox.com/xp/file_assoc.htm

This link is for vista
http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/reset-and-fix-broken-windows-vista-file-ext-and-type-associations-include-exe-com-sys-zip-lnk-folder-drive/

Both of these sites give you .reg files that restore your .exe file association so you can sucessfully open the programs again.

Just make sure the registry association fix you run is compatible with your operating system. If you are not comfortable with doing this then grab your operating system disc and do a repair install.</Content>
