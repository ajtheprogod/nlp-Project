    <Subject>Why does everybody believe that you have wireless internet?</Subject>
    <Content>Whenever I post a question on any forum or question &amp; answer site about my WIRED internet, I always get answers referring to WIRELESS internet. Why? Is WIRELESS internet used by absolutely everybody or something?

    <ChosenAnswer>On a site like this it&#039;s because you get responses from people like me who barely change even a single word from what I may have written ten minutes earlier in response to more or less the same question. It&#039;s out of the laziness or stupidity of the person answering your question, nothing more. In my case, I must emphasize, it&#039;s mostly the former, though perhaps a minimal bit of the latter must occasionally be thrown into the equation as well.

On a real tech support forum though, you should expect a higher level of expertise and attention to detail from the people responding to your question. At least as long as the answer to your question wasn&#039;t already in a sticky or FAQ somewhere, you really do deserve to be shown at least the courtesy of having people read your question and comprehend it properly before responding.</ChosenAnswer>
