  <Question id="20100321140721AAr65U1" type="Answered">
    <Subject>In fanfiction.net, is there a way to get rid of the advertise they show at the beginning of a page?</Subject>
    <Content>When you go to fanfiction.net, they show you this advertise at the beginning of the webpage. So is there a way to get rid of them? You have no idea how annoying they are. And now they have a new ad about &quot;Quality Health&quot; or something, and in this one, you can&#039;t even ignore them. There is no sign that can make you continue to the real webpage. 
So help please? Thanks.

    <ChosenAnswer>When you first go onto fanfiction, hover your cursor over &#039;help&#039; in the top right hand corner (underneath &#039;login&#039; and &#039;sign up&#039;. Then click on &#039;Ad Blocker&#039; which should appear underneath. Click on the &#039;click here&#039; link that comes up with the box and the ad blocker will stop ad&#039;s from popping up for 3 days. After the three days just do it again.
