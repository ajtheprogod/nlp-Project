  <Question id="20100302172621AAc7IhM" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why won&#039;t aim sms messaging work for me anymore?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve been using it for pretty much as long as i&#039;ve been using aim to contact people that have aim.  However, today I tried to message someone to their cell phone and it just doesnt work! What happened? Can someone help me out? What can I do to fix it?
It says they&#039;re offline. Also they can send me messages and I cant message them back. I can message my AIM contacts perfectly fine.
