    <ChosenAnswer>they come up 1-2 a day. There isnt an exact time that it appears; it&#039;s random. The blue, yellow, and green ones are around 100k  and the darigan one is 1.6mil. They&#039;re extremely rare and they get bought out around 1-3 seconds after it&#039;s out, so you need to be fast.</ChosenAnswer>
