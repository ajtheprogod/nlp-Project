  <Question id="20100315131004AAnVkze" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I completely clear/delete my list of favorites in Internet Explorer?</Subject>
    <Content>I want to delete the whole list and start over. How do I do that? (Thank you for your help.)
Added:
You missed my point. (thanks anyway) I am aware of how to delete one at a time. I want to delete hundreds at once. (I have years worth of them) I know there is some way of deleting them all at once.

I need the REAL answer to my question.

    <ChosenAnswer>Although I don&#039;t know...that&#039;s an excellent question. (I gave you a star) I do happen to know you are correct that there IS a way. (I heard it before, but forgot how to do it.) 

Added : OK...I did some searching for you and here is your answer.

All of your Favorites are stored in a folder under your user profile. If you look in C:\Documents and Settings\ (your user name) \ Favorites in Windows XP you will see them all listed as individual files. Delete all or any you want from here and they won&#039;t appear in the list on line.</ChosenAnswer>
