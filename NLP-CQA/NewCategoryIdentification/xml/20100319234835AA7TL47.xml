    <ChosenAnswer>Xanga.com is much more of a community blog. You can quickly make friends there.

Wordpress.com is a professional type blog.

Piczo.com is a blog for teen girls

tumblr.com is a blog that is growing in popularity. Lots of celebrities have tumblrs and it is really unique and personal.


You can make any of these private. Xanga for sure you can post entirely private entries and even lock your blog to where no one can see it but you.</ChosenAnswer>
