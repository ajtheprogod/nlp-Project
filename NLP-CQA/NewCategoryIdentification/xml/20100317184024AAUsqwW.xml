    <ChosenAnswer>It all depends on the blogging platform you&#039;re using.  blogger has a plug-in (or a software) that you can just add onto the blog and it will automatically play music after you upload it onto blogger

Wordpress, however, is another story.  You&#039;ll need to, again, download a plug in that will allow you to put music on the website.

Hope this helps!</ChosenAnswer>
