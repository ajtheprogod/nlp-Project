    <Subject>Toolbar help on internet explorer?</Subject>
    <Content>I don&#039;t know how, but the address bar on the toolbar when I open up windows has dissappeared. Its been like this for a while, and when I right click and re-add the address bar, it only comes up as a grey letters &#039;Address&#039; on the right side of the toolbar. Also, idk if this is linked to it, but if someone gives me a link to a website I can&#039;t access it. How can i fix this?

    <ChosenAnswer>You must be using the very old Internet Explorer 6 ?

First you must unlock the Toolbars then you must right-click, grab and drag the dotted &quot;Move Bar&quot; that is to the left of &#039;Address&#039;. Then extend it as desired.

It is tricky and takes some practice.

The full procedure is here...just click it:

When done, just be sure and &quot;Lock the Toolbars&quot; again.</ChosenAnswer>
