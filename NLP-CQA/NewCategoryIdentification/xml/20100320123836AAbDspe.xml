  <Question id="20100320123836AAbDspe" type="Answered">
    <Subject>You-tube ; how do you cope with the new design / format?</Subject>
    <Content>youtube for years was my most favourite site , top of my list really - but these recent new format changes have really f* hurt me a lot.

im just...speechless , i cant get over it.

they have broken what was working in my opinion and completely ruined the site.



1 ) whats happened to the quick-lists ?


2 ) how do you add videos to your quick-list and save them to a permanent playlist like before ?


3 ) why have they ruined the comments part and ratings part so it is now all &#039;&#039; scrunched up and unclear and disorderly ?



4 ) why have they put that pointless sidebar there with &#039;&#039; auto play &#039;&#039; to a most likely, a video your not interested in watching ?



5 ) why have they removed &#039; related videos &#039; and your personal &#039; quick-lists &#039; from the sidebar ?


6 ) how do you find your quick list even ?






can anyone answer those questions and  :

 how do you cope with the new terrible design and them ruining and suppressing a perfectly working popular website ?



and to mention  ; 

 on internet explorer  it has suddenly changed back to the old likeable format   -  does  this mean  they&#039;re just testing the new format   and they might change it back  ?

    <ChosenAnswer>I really disliked the changes as well, however, I think after awhile you&#039;ll get used to it. Some people do use a few of those features you mentioned, even though you don&#039;t...so others think its necessary probably. I would just try and get used to it...changes will probably be made in the future sometime again.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I don&#039;t know why people are always changing things that are already good and working well, older things are always the best.</Content>
