    <Subject>What wrong with my Firefox browser?</Subject>
    <Content>ok soooo I reinstalled my comp with win7 and started using Firefox obviously (cus internet exploder sucks) and lately it&#039;s been bugging out with links, an example of this would be if I click a link to another page for example, all it does is come up with a download window that has nothing it in and when I try and click the link again after cancelling that, it does nothing. It only seems to happen when I&#039;m on Youtube.

also, before I get any comment saying I have a virus, malware etc, there are 2 thing I should say. 1:I&#039;ve not been on any dodgy sites at all, in fact the most dodgy site I&#039;ve been on is newgrounds if you wish to call that dodgy.
2: I have done multiple scans using Avast! antivirus (on a full scan), IObit security 360 (on a full scan) and Spybot Search and destroy, and found nothing. (all of these programs are legit, not scareware)

It may simply be a case of firefox base files simply becoming fragmented, but I&#039;m still unsure as this has happened before and defragging didn&#039;t seem to do anything. any ideas?
Stupid answers that contradict what I&#039;ve said about internet (exploder) aren&#039;t helpful.

    <ChosenAnswer>First thing i&#039;d do is download Microsoft Security Essentials &amp; run a full scan with that - it knows Windows 7 better than any of the others.

Download the latest Firefox, (3.6) that fixes a few security flaws. Totally uninstall your version of firefox beforehand &amp; make sure you click &#039;delete all user settings&#039; to clear the registry. The built in software uninstaller isn&#039;t perfect so get Revo http://www.revouninstaller.com/ - its a trial but you get it full for 30 days.</ChosenAnswer>
