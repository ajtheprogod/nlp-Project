  <Question id="20100314155023AAKMjf2" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How to download from this site?</Subject>
    <Content>Trying to download papercrafts from http://www.imprime-recorta-pega.com/portal.php, but none of the download buttons work, and I am unable to register an account. I only know English,and Google Translate was no help. Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks man, I was able to get it to work. That site made no sense, when I clicked the news post it brought me to the same page, but the download button didn&#039;t do anything.
