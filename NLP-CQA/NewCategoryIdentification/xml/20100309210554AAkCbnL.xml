    <Subject>Whats a Great Internet Router to buy?</Subject>
    <Content>One that has a great price and is perfectly affordable. I am planning on buying it from Best Buy, but there are so many brands. Linkys and Netgear, but which kind of router is good for my Windows 7 Home Premium laptop. It&#039;s Intel Core, and SureWest provides me the DSL internet. I love the internet on my desktop, and want the same speed for my laptop. So any recommendations? please tell which one and how much it may cost. Understand that i am just a high school student who works for his own money.

    <ChosenAnswer>You want a wireless-N router. There is actually one for 30 bucks, an Airlink 101 AR670W. See amazon link below. It&#039;s the one I use and I&#039;ve never had any problems, my router is upstairs and the downstairs computer&#039;s internet is as fast as the one directly connected to the router.</ChosenAnswer>
