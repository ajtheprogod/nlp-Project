    <Subject>How do I get my Dailybooth photos and tweets onto my blog?</Subject>
    <Content>So I did this before, a while back.  I had a gadget on my blog on Blogger where my most recent Dailybooth photo would show up.  I had a separate gadget where my most recent tweets would show up.  I redesigned my blog and now I can&#039;t figure out what I did before!  And help is greatly appreciated.  I feel like there is a really obvious solution I&#039;m missing. :-/
Thanks much, Tanner!  I now know where the widgets are for Twitter (under Goodies at the bottom of the homepage).  

I still want to know about Dailybooth, though!
