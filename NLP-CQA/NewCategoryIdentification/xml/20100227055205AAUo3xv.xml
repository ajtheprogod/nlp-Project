It&#039;s another form of the &quot;Welcome Wagon&#039;. It&#039;s fine. Nothing&#039;s wrong.

I&#039;d go more into the subject.

            <Content>Hmm. Either someone has hacked your account or there&#039;s a bug with friend requests that we&#039;re not aware of. 

Can you please submit your help request in our support forums so that we can track it if it is indeed a bug? 

thanks!
