            <Content>http://www.literotica.com/  has an erotic chat and other things,but no profile pages,I&#039;m upset about this as well,sure hope it comes back.A chat guy of mine was able to get in thru the way the first poster here has.He spoke to a chat mod and they told him the site was renewed and should be back up within 2 days.He copied and pasted the chat he had with the mod and showed me,so it&#039;s not just heresay.I added the copy and paste that worked from another similar question on here that my chat guy was able to get in thru and talk to the mod on.</Content>
            <Reference>It will likely be back.

Add these three lines temporarily to your hosts file under C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\

174.37.22.18 www.babblesex.com
174.36.228.186 babblesex.com
174.36.228.186 livehubs.com

Edit for Jamie and others who aren&#039;t seeing this work: you will probably need to reboot afterwards.

Edit for Kets: The space got removed when I edited the answer for Jamie. I&#039;ve added the space back to the answer. Sorry for the confusion.</Reference>
