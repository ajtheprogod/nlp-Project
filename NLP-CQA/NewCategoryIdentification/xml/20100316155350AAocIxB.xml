            <Content>the site is running pretty slow because of the growth spurt they had over the past month. this should level out over the next month or so as they update the site to handle the new load of people. 

also try to clear your browser&#039;s cache just in case that&#039;s causing problems. 

you can always try these sites as well:

http://woome.com

            <Content>omegle is just the same as CR except gives you the option to not have video at all. but if you really want CR then try using a different browser? mozilla firefox works well. and about your mom, if you open up a new google chrome browser, then click cntrl+shirt+N, that opens up a new window that doesn&#039;t save your history so your mom won&#039;t know about it. happy chatting...</Content>
