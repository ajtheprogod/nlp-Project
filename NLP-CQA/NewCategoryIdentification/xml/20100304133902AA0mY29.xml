    <ChosenAnswer>You need a credit or debit or prepaid debit card.  

Then, go to a site and find something you want to buy.  

Click on the button to put the item in your shopping cart or to purchase the item.  Each site works a little differently.  

When you have items you want in your cart and are done shopping, find the &quot;checkout&quot; button and click it.  

You will be given forms to fill out and buttons to click.  

Provide all the requested info and click the buttons you are directed to click.  

Done.</ChosenAnswer>
