  <Question id="20100328180543AAoWq7r" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Firefox and CPU spike.?</Subject>
    <Content>Firefox is a decent browser to use but I&#039;ve come to the point where I can&#039;t really use it anymore because it spikes my CPU up to 100% and stays there for quite a while. When it&#039;s not at 100% it&#039;s around like 80% or so. It&#039;s really annoying especially when I am just browsing sites or trying to watch a video and everything just locks up. Once I close Firefox my CPU will come right back down. Anyone have any insight? And please don&#039;t tell me to download another browser. Been there, done that.
