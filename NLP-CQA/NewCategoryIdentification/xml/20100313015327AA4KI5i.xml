  <Question id="20100313015327AA4KI5i" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How does China&#039;s internet filter work?</Subject>
    <Content>I was curious as to how China&#039;s internet filter works.  I know that some internet filters work by having a list of existing sites that are blocked, but I was told by someone that in China, all websites needed to be aproved before they can be accessed.  Is this true?

Thanks.

    <ChosenAnswer>I decided to do a bit of research on this question, and found a couple of sites with significant information on the issue. China is creating a whitelist of &#039;registered&#039; websites, and will probably eventually start blocking all but these websites ( according to http://surlz.net/7 ). Currently, however, China maintains a secret blacklist of websites they do not like, containing explicit images, politically sensitive topics, and other information they don&#039;t want their citizens to see. These websites are then filtered down at the DNS level. China&#039;s schools and internet cafes are also required to run &quot;Green Dam Youth Escort&quot; on their computers, which also blocks websites the government doesn&#039;t want citizens to see. ( http://surlz.net/8 ) I shortened the links of some reference websites about the filter for you :)

        <Answer>
            <Content>There&#039;s no whitelist, and they&#039;re not creating one. The previous poster is mixing up websites in general with domain names under the .CN top-level domain.

For websites in general:
- Default is: allow.
- Some websites/ISP&#039;s are blocked on IP address level.
- Some websites are blocked in the DNS, meaning when you type twitter.com you don&#039;t get a twitter IP address, but some dead server which doesn&#039;t respond.
- Some websites are keyword filtered. Meaning that you can access the website but that pages containing certain words are blocked.

For websites under the .CN domain:
- These are currently being white-listed. This is not a new development though. Websites *hosted* in China have always required and so-called &quot;ICP&quot; license. They are now extending this license requirement to any domain under .CN. Actually this requirement was always there, but never enforced.
- You can still host a website in China without an ICP license, but technically it&#039;s illegal and when you&#039;re shut down you have no legal recourse.
- Foreign domain names/websites will still be allowed by default and only blocked if objectionable content is found.</Content>
