  <Question id="20100315213431AAHfLW8" type="Answered">
    <Subject>My domain name has expired but my details are still on Whois?</Subject>
    <Content>I paid my subscription 2 weeks after it expired and now some anonymous person is using it. My domain provider won&#039;t answer my letters or emails. Should I just give up on this and just register a new domain name and cut my losses?
http://domains.whois.com still shows MY details as domain owner. Other WHOIS sites says someone else. Confused!
