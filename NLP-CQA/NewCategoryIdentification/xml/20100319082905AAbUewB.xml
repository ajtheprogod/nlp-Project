  <Question id="20100319082905AAbUewB" type="Answered">
    <Subject>More Funny than Wrong or More Wrong than Funny?</Subject>
    <Content>Just for kicks, I&#039;m thinking about creating a fake dating profile and uploading some pics of a really hot male model just to see what kind of responses I get from women.  I woudn&#039;t respond or lead them on or anything.  I&#039;m not that cruel.  Would this be funny as hell or over the line, or both, or neither?
Mind you, I would not solicit any contact or respond to any contacts.  So, there no playing with emotions going on here.
