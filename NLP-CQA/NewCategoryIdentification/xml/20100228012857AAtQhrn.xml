    <Subject>How many times.........?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok, well I just want to ask what do I use as a fake address, fake email, fake number and all that for surveys so i can watch a movie online for free? I don&#039;t trust giving out my information like that. So how can I give out fake stuff and it not actually be someone&#039;s information? Help please?

    <ChosenAnswer>First, never give a phone # or street address or actual birthDAY. I always just use the 1st, then my real mo. &amp; yr.(easy to remember) Use the # 100 and one street over for your address. (again, easy to remember). same town &amp; zip though. Say you don,t have a phone. And lastly, slightly misspell your last name, like use a Y instead of an I, or add &quot;son&quot; or &quot;ski&quot; to the end. An example: change &quot;Jane Barns&quot; to &quot;Jayne Barnski&quot; You get the idea. Just keep it close to the truth so it&#039;s easy to remember. I usu a blank journal I got for $3 at Dollar General.  You see, these sites aren&#039;t secure. Too easy to hack. You&#039;re being smart.</ChosenAnswer>
