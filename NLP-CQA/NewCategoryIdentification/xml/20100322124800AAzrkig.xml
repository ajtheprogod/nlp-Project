    <Subject>How is the internet connected to my brother&#039;s Wii?</Subject>
    <Content>My brother can get on any page on the Internet with his Wii Console. How does he do that when we don&#039;t pay for wireless internet or have our home internet hook up to it. It&#039;s like the Wii came with it&#039;s own free internet package. 

I don&#039;t how, but it&#039;s weird.......

    <ChosenAnswer>He could be stealing any nearby neighbors unsecured wireless signal.

While it is technically illegal, as long as he doesn&#039;t use excessive bandwidth or make it obvious (downloading files, torrents, using the bandwidth..ect.) that he is on it to the owner, he will not get caught.</ChosenAnswer>
