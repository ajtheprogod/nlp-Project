    <Subject>Is being paid to spam craigslist bad?</Subject>
    <Content>I LOVE craigslist!
Now there is a site that pays you to spam them!
craigspimp.com is the site, and it is making me pretty scared that craigslist will change.

what can I do to stop it?

Do you think it is morally wrong to spam craigslist for monetary gain?
