    <ChosenAnswer>Unless you have a rare name, such as Xavier, then just use your first name, especially if it is common, like John or Mike, then append it with a number. For example: Mike1985 or John316 or something...you usually don&#039;t have to give your full name for online forums, but if you are entering a sweepstakes on-line, you will likely need to use your legal name, as you would need to be able to endorse the check to cash it (as in the case of a cash prize).</ChosenAnswer>
