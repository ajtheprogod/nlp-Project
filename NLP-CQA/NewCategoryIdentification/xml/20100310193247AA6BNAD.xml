    <Subject>Is www.onlinedatesafe.com a good website?</Subject>
    <Content>A girl I met on the internet said I need to verify my identity, and this site asks for my credit card #. Sounds like a scam, or is this a real way to do background checks for online dating?

            <Content>Any site asking you to enter a credit card is a scam that will charge your card and max it out. These are all scams, they just keep changing their name every month or two. There is nothing in a credit card number that can verify your age, identity or criminal background. When 16 year olds can now get credit cards, and it&#039;s easy for anyone to use a stolen credit card number, this would be the least safe way of verifying your identity. Any sex offender would be smart enough to use a stolen credit card for verification
This is not a real girl, she is either an escort of a porn spambot. You should never enter your cc  on any site for verification unless you want to lose thousands. If they wanted to verify your identity they would ask for a copy of your passport, birth certificate or other govt issued identification, never a credit card</Content>

            <Content>Here&#039;s a new social/dating site that just launched. I like it because it&#039;s actually a little different for others. You can actually do a community video chat or private video chat, you can post ads the same as you would do on craig&#039;s list, and if you fill out the contact us form at the bottom of the the page and send it off with requesting a free upgrade they will upgrade you for FREE!!!! for 30 days!! WOOT WOOT cant go wrong with free!!!
p.s. Personally I would give out my cc and personal info to a site requesting it...</Content>
