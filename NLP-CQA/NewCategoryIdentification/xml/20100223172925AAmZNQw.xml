    <ChosenAnswer>its sounds good, but once people put some thing in it, the site would start losing hits. It would be good for a couple of months.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I think your idea is excellent but if it&#039;s a time capsule the people who participate might tell you they want that item sent to them 5, 10, or 20 years from now. You might want to limit how much time into the future you would be willing to do this, you don&#039;t want to make false promises especiallly if you&#039;re trying to make your name or business known for gaining future business.</Content>

            <Content>I guess its a nice idea......

I have to suggest that you might want to put a in something extra that will make your site a bit more unique. Perhaps you should allow pictures and small audio and video clips. Or perhaps you can have a collage or something like that which the users can make and send to themselves or other emails. 

these are just ideas....

I guess that you&#039;ll have to promote your website well</Content>
