    <ChosenAnswer>Yes, they&#039;re reliable, and if you get stung in a user deal, just report it to Amazon&#039;s management and they&#039;ll refund your money.

The only problem I&#039;ve had over there is that Amazon&#039;s private user sellers often list their merchandise on several websites, like eBay and others, and then, if the item sells somewhere else, they don&#039;t bother to remove the listing from Amazon, so on several occasions I&#039;ve had my order cancelled because the item is no longer available, which is very annoying and frustrating and a total waste of time, too!

Good luck!...</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Don&#039;t know what you mean by a &quot;user&quot; on Amazon.  Amazon sells both directly and through &quot;associated&quot; retailers.  I buy from Amazon regularly and have never had problems.</Content>

            <Content>Amazon is usually pretty good at using reputable companies. Now I have heard of bad business being done as well. Amazon does its best to make good on the situation though. 

If you are not trusting enough to do business online, then I would recommend purchasing the item directly from a retail store. You may pay a few more dollars but you will have the satisfaction of being able to take it right back to the store if it doesn&#039;t work.</Content>
