  <Question id="20100323175122AAJkUYc" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Craigslist issues????</Subject>
    <Content>So a friend of mine and I have, I guess you could call it a  &#039;&#039;Handy Jobs Service&#039;&#039;
I was needing to post in &#039;&#039;Household services&#039;&#039; to advertise our services.
For some reason Craiglist is asking for a -PHONE NUMBER VERIFICATION-
To ensure that a phone is working in case of contact needs I guess.

So is craigslist suppost to be doing that, I mean I&#039;ve never really had a craigslist account, flyers are for me.

Thanks alot in advance

    <ChosenAnswer>Yes that is normal. They don&#039;t use it to allow people to call, they use it so that if they ban you for some reason, you won&#039;t be able to use the same number again.</ChosenAnswer>
