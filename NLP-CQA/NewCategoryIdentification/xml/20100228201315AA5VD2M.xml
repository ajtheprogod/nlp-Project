            <Content>it doesn&#039;t take too long to set up a paypal account. it&#039;s the safest way to pay... other wise your taking a risk.....not everyone sends the stuff. some people just take your money and if its with paypal and they don&#039;t send you your stuff then you can open a dispute and get things settled</Content>

            <Content>Yes, most places love to take credit cards. Some places will only take paypal (it&#039;s really not that difficult to set up). Some places will take both. And some places will only take certified checks or money orders. But always check out who your doing business with before you give them any financial info.</Content>

            <Content>ebay is the best I have bought everything from sets of car tires to a box of furnace filters from ball joints for my jeep to a grand theft auto pc game that came from Russia.
Ebay has everything you could ever think of and 99 times out of 100 you can get a lot better deal than buying else wheres but you do have to wait to get it but that&#039;s never very long.
and pay pal is very easy to use and you can use it other places than just ebay</Content>
