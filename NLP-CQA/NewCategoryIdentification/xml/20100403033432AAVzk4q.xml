    <Subject>What happens if a seller does not reply to a your paypal refund request ?</Subject>
    <Content>Recently i bought some products from an online seller, his reputation wasn&#039;t bad and he had positive reviews. However, after i paid him the money through paypal he told me that he was out of stock and that I would have to wait an &#039;indefinite&#039; amount of time before he resupplied. Therefore, i decided to get a refund on the product. I informed the seller on this, and he agreed. Since then i have sent him a refund request through paypal for the amount i paid, but he has yet to reply or respond to me. What can i do if he continues to &#039;not&#039; respond to my refund request?
