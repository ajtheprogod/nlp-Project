            <Content>I personally hard-coded my own website, and have it coexist with a free http://www.freeforums.org forum. 

Adobe Dreamweaver is an excellent, user-friendly website coder. For those not so fluent with HTML. IT costs a pretty penny, though.</Content>

            <Content>Hi , Recently by &quot;Googling&quot; I&#039;ve found this free website builder Mosite
http://www.mosite.org/
After registration, you can create without knowing a line of code, sites in flash with effects,animations,photoslide and more without templates.
There are thousands of vector graphics and dozens of fonts to use and you can also upload images from your PC.
Seems to be new in the web because there are no guides or whatever, the only thing is the forum on http://forum.mosite.org/
and a video on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2ZjbOTd4YI that show you how it work!
it seems that is a good Promise,take a look.
bye!</Content>
