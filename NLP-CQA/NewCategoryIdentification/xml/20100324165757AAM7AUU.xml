            <Content>The link that Jason gave you pays an ongoing commission of 10% of what the model earns. You continue to earn that commission as long as the model is working.

livejasmin also pays you to signup models, but I stopped recruiting for them, because they reduce your commission every couple of months and after they model has been with them for a year they stop paying you. They don&#039;t tell you that upfront though, they just tell you that you get a 36% commission.</Content>
