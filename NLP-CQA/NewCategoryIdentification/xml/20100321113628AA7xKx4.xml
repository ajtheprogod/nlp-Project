  <Question id="20100321113628AA7xKx4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why do people answer others with @ before their name?</Subject>
    <Content>@chris1emt -- is this a result of the popularity of Twitter?  I&#039;ve noticed this in the past several weeks but it has NEVER been popular before, I&#039;ve never even seen it before in any message board or forum anywhere.

    <ChosenAnswer>Doing that is a sign that a person isn&#039;t very bright. Some might say it&#039;s only done by stupid people.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yeah, some people use it to reference a person or their username on just about any online message board, forum, even facebook. I think the &#039;@&#039; character highlights that a person is referencing someone. And it&#039;s also due to the popularity of Twitter, like what you mentioned.</Content>
