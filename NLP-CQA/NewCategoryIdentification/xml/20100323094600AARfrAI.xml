            <Content>Sure just get a web cam and make your own, you can call it &quot;&lt;insert your name&gt;&#039;s whore palace&quot; or something like that. The cool thing is it doesn&#039;t even matter what you look like. If you are like 500lbs or missing a leg or whatever, there are people out there that will still want to see you naked</Content>

            <Content>Lots of luck on that one. You and million-s of other people are looking for the same thing. And for the most part, such &quot;jobs&quot; don&#039;t exist. You pay us first is a major warning sign. About the only people who make any real money are those who start their own web site.</Content>
