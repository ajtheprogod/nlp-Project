    <Subject>Do you know of an internet site like this?</Subject>
    <Content>A site for cooking where a person can put in certain ingredients to find recipes, which would be good for cleaning out remaining ingredients in a pantry. Like if a person has tomatoes, apples, and mayonaise, puts it in the search generator, then gets recipes that only has those three ingredients.

    <ChosenAnswer>Some DS games such as Cooking Guide have incorporated this type of feature - but they&#039;re are extremely limited because they don&#039;t have many recipes in the database. Any internet site will be just as limited and not very useful.

You can always just google all of the items you plan to use and the word recipe in one search and see what recipes come up.</ChosenAnswer>
