  <Question id="20100301123845AAP27yJ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>wheres a place where i can go and rant about my bad times?</Subject>
    <Content>i want a website (free) were  i can sit down and just let out all my angry (in words) 
 and people want to hear about it and ahh i dunno give me some advise or just say 
  &#039; hey i&#039;ve been there to my friend..&quot;

... um A.K.A  i need a site where i can rant... and get out my angry...

..um i dunno how to make it more clearer so does anyone know any sites like that? 
 i mean i can go on google myself i look for one sure yeah 
but  i like having other people&#039;s opinions .. just to be safe.
yeah i don&#039;t think a blog would help me any
 i have one on deviantart (journal ) 
 and lately my friends on there seem 
 to be a little busy and not really paying 
 me that much of attention but hey
 it&#039;s cool...  i know they have they&#039;re own lives and probably don&#039;t spend 
 as much time online as i do..

            <Content>You could start a blog, but nobody reads them I don&#039;t think!
You could use Y!A, people rant on here all the time, but make sure you finish it off with a question otherwise people get ticked off!</Content>

            <Content>why don&#039;t you just rant on yahoo answers? although people might think it&#039;s annoying, who really cares? i do it alot. just make a question called something like, &quot;what can i do? it&#039;s driving me crazy?!&quot; or something like that, and just rant on for ages, then at the bottom, put &#039;have you ever felt like this&#039; or something. hope i helped :)</Content>
