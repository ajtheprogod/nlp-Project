    <ChosenAnswer>Basically, you go to your page, or on the dashboard and click &quot;customize.&quot; Then, under the themes tab, click &quot;use custom HTML.&quot; If you know how to read HTML you should be good from there, but if you don&#039;t Scroll down until you see this:

body {
background: {color:Background} url(’/themes/4/bg.gif’);
margin: 0px 0px 50px 60px;
font: Normal 13px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
color: {color:Text};

or something like that. I usually hit Ctrl+F to just find the word background so I don&#039;t have to scroll and read all the html. Then, replace the url: (/themes/4/bg.gif) in this case and add the image that you want. If it&#039;s your own personal picture, upload it onto tinypic or something like that. Make sure before you grab the url, you open the image in a new tab by itself so you&#039;re not copying and pasting the full webpage.

You should be good from there. If you have trouble feel free to message me on my own tumblr :)</ChosenAnswer>
