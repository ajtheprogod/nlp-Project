            <Content>The key to getting followers in Twitter is by following others.  However, you probably don&#039;t want to follow just anybody.  You want to follow people who are interested in the things that you are interested in.  So make a list of 7 keywords or things that you are interested in and then watch this video about how to sign-up for a free Twitter application that will allow you to follow people using your keywords.  Because you both share an interest, there is a high probability that they will follow you back.
