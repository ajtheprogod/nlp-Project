    <ChosenAnswer>Lockerz is legit and you will get your T shirt. Lockerz is a new start up company that has just a few paid staff so it takes a while for them to respond to all emails and requests. I got my iPod touch about 4 weeks after redeeming my PTZ so be patient.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Lockerz is a scam and a half.

They are probably &quot;Fresh-Out&quot; of t-shirts like they are with everything else!</Content>

            <Content>You will get your shirt in a few weeks. Lockerz is not a scam!  

But I did switch to swagbucks because Lockerz is difficult to win. Swagbucks is much better. Prizes are always in stock!!! Its just like a google search engine but you randomly win swagbucks for searching. Theres many other ways to win too. Ive made over $100 in amazon.com gift cards. Try it out-   http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</Content>

            <Content>Once you become a z-lister, got to your account settings and put in your address details. It will also ask for what size T-shirt you want. You don&#039;t get a confirmation email because they will send it automatically.</Content>
