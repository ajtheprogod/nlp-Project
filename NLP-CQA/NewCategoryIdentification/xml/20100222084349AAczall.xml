  <Question id="20100222084349AAczall" type="Answered">
    <Subject>how can i get free internet at my house legally?</Subject>
    <Content>So I just moved into my new apartment and need to get some high speed internet and cable. I need to call the cable company to set it up. Now the problem is that I would like to get internet access for my computer. I have a wireless antena that I always used when I was over living at my moms house. Now the problem is that I have moved out and dont have internet. The town where I live is offering free wifi for all town residents but the problem is that they have not gotten to my part of town yet to set it up.

Internet is expensive. Is there a way to connect my wireless antena to the internet via high speed or wifi for free? I am looking for something leagal (if possible)
