    <Subject>Slow download speed with Firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>For the past couple weeks my downloads have been taking absolutely ages with Firefox. It&#039;s taking up to 2 and a half hours to download software and albums which used to take 20 minutes at the most a few months ago. I do regular registry checks and things like that, plus my internet itself is really quite fast. Does anybody know what could be causing the slow download speed?

    <ChosenAnswer>Could be a number of reasons, mainly I would have thought that your broadband provider are upgrading their systems which seems to be happening a lot just lately especially if your using ADSL and the BT phone network.

Damage has been done to the system and you are being routed through different exchanges and servers.

If your phone line has developed line noise that will also drag your speed down. Ask for a line test.

Also check your providers service status which is usually on their home page.</ChosenAnswer>
