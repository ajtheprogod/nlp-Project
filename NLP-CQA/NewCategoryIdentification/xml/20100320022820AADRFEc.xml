    <ChosenAnswer>Just clear all your browsing data (i.e. Cookies, History, Cache, etc). If that does not work, open another web browser that you did not use to visit the &quot;website&quot; when she comes home. So if she goes on the internet, she is already in that web browser and might not bother to open another.</ChosenAnswer>
