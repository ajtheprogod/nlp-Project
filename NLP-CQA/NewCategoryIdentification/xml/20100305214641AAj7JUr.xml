    <Subject>Wireless internet signal?</Subject>
    <Content>Usually, the internet signal from my computer allows my laptop to get the internet. Its not doing that today. Other than waiting or contacting someone over the phone, how do I resolve this? I have a few people living here so Im not satisfied with just one computer..
To the first answer, I have no idea what youre talking about. Please be more visual and descriptive.
