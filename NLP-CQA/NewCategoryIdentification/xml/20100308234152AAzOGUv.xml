            <Content>Well, I have not tried p2s so cannot comment there But as far as lockerz or swagbucks. I have kept an eye on lockerz&#039;s members on their facebook wall and everyone was complaining that there their gifts are always out of stock. and when they stock, they&#039;re gone in few minutes.
My suggestion is to sign up for swagbucks if you want to earn money for searching, I signed up for it about 3 months ago. Unlike lockerz, swagbucks makes it easy to earn bucks and more importantly redeemable bucks.
My favorites are the $5 amazon cards and $5 payapl credit.
I have signed up about 3 months ago and have $25 in my amazon account and I am not a heavy user. I am also saving for christmas shopping on amazon this year.. (Do not like Mall crowds :))
Here is a link to sign up:

Use it for your daily searches. Here is my recommendation to get more points.
In the morning, search on swagbucks, wait 30 seconds and search again, and so on until you get bucks, then wait for 2-3 hours and repeat till you get bucks and so on.
Also watch the swidget because almost every day, they post a code for extr bucks.
And lastly, check the special offers page for videos to watch and get more bucks..</Content>
