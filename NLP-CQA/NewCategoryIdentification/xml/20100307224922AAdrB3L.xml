    <Subject>How can I find a video if I have one frame from it?</Subject>
    <Content>I have one frame from a video and I need to find the source. Is there a video search engine that I can upload the frame to and get videos that contain this frame?
Since it&#039;s a scientific film of bacteria shot through a microscope (not a popular film)
