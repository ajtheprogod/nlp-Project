    <Subject>how can i get more experience with call of duty?</Subject>
    <Content>i really want to get started on playing call of duty, its just that when i ask my brother if i can play, he gets mad ( for some apparent reason) and tells me to go away. i think he doesn&#039;t want me to die too many times on his account. so how do i get more experience with this game, and get good enough so that i can attempt to play? also i hate asking my brother for help, so i want to get at a good enough stage when i can just tell my brother to leave and let me have fun.

    <ChosenAnswer>You should make your own account. It&#039;s only 8 dollars a month on xbox live. I&#039;m sure you can scrounge up 8 dollars in a month. And you should play ( and beat ) the game on veteran. Then I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have enough experience to play well.</ChosenAnswer>
