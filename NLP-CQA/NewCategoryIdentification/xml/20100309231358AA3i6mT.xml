  <Question id="20100309231358AA3i6mT" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I get comedian to notice me?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok, so I want your SERIOUS advice. Meaning, I need you to do some thinking for me. There&#039;s a comedian I like, I won&#039;t say who but you&#039;ve most likely never heard of him. He&#039;s pretty successful online, and like most good comedians, he has a twitter. And it&#039;s hilarious. Only problem is, he never &quot;tweets&quot; at anybody, just writes funny things. If I keep tweeting funny things at him do you think eventually he&#039;ll notice me? Or think I&#039;m a stalker? I just think he&#039;s the coolest and I want him and I to meet. He&#039;s not Tom Cruise but he has been in some major things. I also know he&#039;s single. Other prob-- he lives in LA and I live in NY but it&#039;s not that big of a prob....

Please help? I want to be forward with him but not stalkerish. Please don&#039;t tell me unnecessary things.
Do you think he reads his direct msgs? He has about 50,000 followers.

    <ChosenAnswer>Tweet him. See what happens. Ask about where he gets his inspiration, what his favorite joke or line is... People love talking about themselves as a general rule. I think it&#039;s a good opener. Good luck ya freaky stalker ;)</ChosenAnswer>
