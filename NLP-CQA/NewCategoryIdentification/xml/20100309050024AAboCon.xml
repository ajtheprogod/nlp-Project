  <Question id="20100309050024AAboCon" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Website are blocked....?</Subject>
    <Content>I have internet explorer - OmniGlobe. The only website a can really get into, and browse, are Yahoo! Answers and AOL. But when I try to get into any other site, the URL goes from, www.youtube.com, to, about: blank, and takes me to a page that says blocked and This page can not be displayed.
But if it does go to the homepage, I can&#039;t browse the site. I have no idea what is wrong.

Does anyone have any idea of what might be wrong? And how I could &#039;fix&#039; this problem?
