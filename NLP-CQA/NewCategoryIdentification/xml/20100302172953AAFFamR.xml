            <Content>It depends on the Company. For instance if you had the name &quot;Fritos&quot;, you could get a tidy sum. If you have &quot;Joe Shmoe&#039;s Deli&quot; then you aren&#039;t going to get too much. :)</Content>

            <Content>Say no until they offer you higher sums. If you don&#039;t think it is worth it then say no. If it&#039;s a big company then you might want to sell it.</Content>
