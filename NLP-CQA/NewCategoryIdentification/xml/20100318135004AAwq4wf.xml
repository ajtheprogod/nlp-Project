    <ChosenAnswer>without more information on your system and the components in it, would be hard to accurately say, but it sounds like you either have 2 lan cards or a lan card and a wifi on that computer.
Right click on &quot;My Network Places&quot; select properties
Right click local area connection 2, and select disable
that will prevent the local area connection 2 and keep the other one as the main.</ChosenAnswer>
