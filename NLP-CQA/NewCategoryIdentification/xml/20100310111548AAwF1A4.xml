  <Question id="20100310111548AAwF1A4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why can&#039;t I follow people on twitter anymore?</Subject>
    <Content>I tried to follow someone on twitter but I got an error message, which referred me to this page; http://help.twitter.com/forums/10713/entries/66885 - According to this explanation I can follow 2,000 people and I need more followers to be able to follow more people. But the thing is that I am following only 27 people and I&#039;m being followed by 918 people. So I don&#039;t get the problem? I did unfollow a lot of people recently, could that have to do something with it?

    <ChosenAnswer>Your account seems to be significantly unbalanced and you probably appear to be a spammer to Twitter.  If you don&#039;t rectify this, you risk having your account suspended.

Try following a significant amount of the people that are following you.  If you&#039;re not following people, Twitter may think that you are just promoting and advertising and not engaging in social communication.</ChosenAnswer>
