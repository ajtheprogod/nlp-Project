    <Subject>Is regular phone cord OK to use to connect my DSL modem?</Subject>
    <Content>It&#039;s just regular phone cord, the kind you can get 50 feet of at Wal-Mart.  Will that support the bandwidth, or do I need something special?
I should&#039;ve been more specific: this is the cable that will connect the modem to the wall - not the ethernet cable . . .

            <Content>Yes, you need something special.  It&#039;s called a network cable.  A bit more expenisive, but a phone cable just wont do it.

There are 8 plugs in your network port, and only 4 pins on a phone cable.  8 pins, because it needs them to do it&#039;s job.

Grab a network cable.  Specifically a Patch cable.</Content>

            <Content>Yes, it will work but I would use the shortest one possible.That will only work to connect your modem to the phone jack on the wall;-)

BTW: It does have to have 4 contacts on it and there are usually green in color.</Content>

            <Content>It should work, that&#039;s what I&#039;m using now.
I hope you don&#039;t mean DSL out to Computer, for that you need an Ethernet cable. But for phone line into DSL modem any regular phone line should work.</Content>
