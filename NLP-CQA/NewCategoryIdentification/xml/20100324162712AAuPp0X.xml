    <Subject>Downloads.nl? what do you sayyy?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi, I download a lot of music from downloads.nl.
And i was just wondering - my computer has been giving me alot of &quot;Found tracking cookie&quot; threat things - would this be from this website?
Also lately my music has been choppy from time to time on itunes =/ and i Do scan my music before putting it on to itunes, and none of my music has any found threats on it.
Thanks ! :)

    <ChosenAnswer>Tyler, http://www.downloads.nl/ is only one site in http://searchformusic.eu.pn/ (it searches many sites).

Tracking cookies are very common in almost every site, &amp; they are useful, but some antivirus software dislikes them.</ChosenAnswer>
