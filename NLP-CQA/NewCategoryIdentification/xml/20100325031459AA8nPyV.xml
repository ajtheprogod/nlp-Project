            <Content>You can effectively see if you&#039;re having the same speed issues using another browser (is it page loading or the browser itself that&#039;s sluggish?). If it&#039;s a generalized issue with your computer, you might want to defragment you hard drive. If it&#039;s Firefox, try disabling the extensions you&#039;re using (if you have any) and see what difference that makes. If that doesn&#039;t help, you can always try uninstalling/reinstalling Firefox.</Content>
