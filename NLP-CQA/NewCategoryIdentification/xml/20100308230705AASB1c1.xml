            <Content>We cant say any site as a trust worthy site..
There are some hacker to hack our datas 
without the knowledge of the owner of the sit itself..

But in way2sms, up to me nothing is happened like that..
U can trust.. They r asking just mobile no. to register..

U can register without any kind of doubts. 
Its really good.. u can send group sms at a time.
It possess some SMS templates too to select from it under several categories.

Here u can use the Yahoo &amp; Gmail messenger which comes along with this website...

Use it. U can feel the difference.</Content>
