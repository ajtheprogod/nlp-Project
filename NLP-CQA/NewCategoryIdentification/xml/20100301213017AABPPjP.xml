    <ChosenAnswer>I stay in different hotels constantly dealing with configuring new PS3 connections, so I know it can be a pain because I NEVER have access to the router. So I can never reset it or unplug it or fiddle with settings. I have tried all kinds of different dns servers, changing gateway/router/ip settings, etc. I would consider myself very computer/networking literate. When I can&#039;t get the wireless on the PS3 to connect to the PSN network or if I have internet connection issues using wifi, I&#039;ll do a shared connection with my laptop, meaning I&#039;ll physically get a cat-5e ethernet cable and connect it to the rear of the PS3 and the other end into the ethernet port on my laptop. Then I&#039;ll configure the following settings:

This is on Windows Vista, but other versions of Windows should be about the same. Using this method, I have not had any further issues and I don&#039;t have to worry about other settings.

Go to: network connections:
wireless-&gt;right click properties
sharing tab-&gt;allow other network users to connect thru this computer&#039;s internet connection (it&#039;s ics (internet connection sharing).
settings-&gt; allow http &amp; https
Ok.
Connect a cat 5 cable from the ps3 to your laptop&#039;s ethernet connection.
Go to PS3 network settings and choose Wired connection with everything automatic, dhcp do not set, everything else enabled.

It should obtain an ip address and network connection.</ChosenAnswer>
