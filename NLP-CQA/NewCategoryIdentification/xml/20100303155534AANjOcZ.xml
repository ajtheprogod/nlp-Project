  <Question id="20100303155534AANjOcZ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I get rid of the &quot;Favorites&quot; and &quot;History&quot; sections on the Internet Explorer Address bar?</Subject>
    <Content>I would like to get rid of these two sections just because I don&#039;t use them. I always use the down arrow on the address bar as well as the auto-complete. Is there anyway for the address bar to only show websites I&#039;ve typed in and not my history or favorites when I click the down arrow?
These sections are list of previously viewed websites that appear after I click on the down arrow. I am not sure how to explain it better. It is not the favorites bar but part of the address bar.

    <ChosenAnswer>Ok, First to disable the Favorites Bar, you need to go over the toolbar section and right-click.
Then a small window shows up and click on the one you want to disable. In your case it is the Favorites bar.
Here:
Hover over toolbar&gt;Right-Click&gt;Click desired toolbar.

Hope this helps!!!</ChosenAnswer>
