  <Question id="20100307083710AAiq2a2" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can I order anything off the internet from anywhere?</Subject>
    <Content>(I live in Canada)

I&#039;m browsing online for prom dresses
and I&#039;m going through, which I think to believe are,
American promgirl sites .. Does it matter if I live in Canada
or not ? Is it always possible to buy anything online?
There are these prom dresses that are super nice ..
I just don&#039;t want to get too excited if I&#039;m not able to
purchase them!

Please help! I can&#039;t wait to order my prom dress soon!
Thaaaaanks

    <ChosenAnswer>Certain places may or may not ship internationally. *USUALLY* US places will ship to Canada (which I like to call North United States ;-) ), but you should contact them to find out just in case.</ChosenAnswer>
