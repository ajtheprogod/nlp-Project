    <ChosenAnswer>give some room for negotiation, if you want to sell a scooter for 100 dollars, try putting it at 150-200.  also consider that you might be overpricing the items to begin with, is it truely worth the price you&#039;re asking?  just because one sold on ebay at that price, or you see it&#039;s valued at it, craigslist users might only want to pay half of it&#039;s worth so they can sell it later on at the price they paid for it.  In this economy people have to try to save money wherever they can, so the main problem might be just that, economy.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Hi, here are some tips:

1. is it really worth $100, check some other ads and compare the prices
2. on your ad try putting a thing that says&quot; the scooter is $100 and I will not accept lower offers.&quot;

I hope i helped you!</Content>
