    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;ve had over 263 offers credit for a total of 167.18 points - in less than half a year. Custom offers are easily my favorite part of PR: I&#039;ve successfully requested Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, and the Half-Life 1 Anthology. &#039;nuff said. :D As an aside, I really can&#039;t wait until Portal 2. I have 50 points that I really don&#039;t know what to do with. As an aside - I&#039;d be in your debt if you signed up on my referral link. Thanks!

[EDIT]: Very helpful programs: Greasemonkey (runs scripts in an extension), Just Say NO! (useful script on userscripts.org), and Roboform (enters in info automatically). If you&#039;re using Chrome you don&#039;t need Greasemonkey, but extensions work best in Firefox.

[EDIT]: Please be honest if you&#039;re going to forward traffic to your videos. Similar tutorials can be found if you search YouTube and filter by most views. Good video, but not the best place to put it.

[EDIT]: Had to create a new account because somebody took a grudge to me - if you see a Top Contributor named Chemaqua, pay your respects to the dead. If you see an answerer named Thom, give him a swift kick in the pants. ^_^

[Final EDIT]: Looks like a vote.

            <Content>I &lt;3 prize rebel. Alot. The PRIMARY reason being is that, WHILE im not gonna talk any bs and tell you the offers are easy. They&#039;re not difficult, but they are tedious (but your gonna get that from any site). Anyway, the main reason i enjoy it is because for game codes (like xbox live points) they EMAIL them too you, instead of having to give away your adress(:
