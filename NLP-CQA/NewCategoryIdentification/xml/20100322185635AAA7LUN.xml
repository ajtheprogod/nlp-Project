  <Question id="20100322185635AAA7LUN" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Looking for a free domain registry and hosting site.?</Subject>
    <Content>I want my own domain name (that means no extensions past .com) and a host that&#039;s free. I know there are definitely going to repercussions to this. I don&#039;t mind them advertising on my site (as long as there isn&#039;t video advertisement), or their being the &#039;owners&#039; of it either. It&#039;s just a simple little picture site so I don&#039;t need much storage space either. 

It&#039;s probably extremely hard to find a host like this these days, but if you know one thanks for the help.

You can try that link but I would suggest that you go with a paid host that offers a free domain because you won&#039;t find that with free hosts unless you get their sub-domain and then have the URL redirected.

I can give you three sites that can help you with that.

For low cost hosting that offers a free 1 year domain
http://texasdatahost.co.cc

For free web hosting
http://myadtv.co.cc/224273

To redirect the sub-domain that you get from free web hosting
