    <Subject>how to fix a broken link?????</Subject>
    <Content>I really need to go to a certain web site but it says the link is broken. How do I fix that? Just a few days ago I could go to that site but now I can&#039;t. I also tried to view it with my phone and it was working! However on my phone I can&#039;t view certain things I need. Is something wrong with my computer because the web site is working on my phone?

    <ChosenAnswer>Broken link normally just means that the page you are looking for is not there any more.

If you are trying to go to a particular page, try to just go to the main site instead.

example:
instead of going to http://www.website.com/page1.htm just try http://www.website.com

Your mobile device might be using a page that is specifically for mobile devices - not the same as your desktop.</ChosenAnswer>
