            <Content>As stated before, there have been questions like this been asked before you.

The best way to unblock your schools filter and get on sites like Facebook, Myspace etc, is a proxy server.

Here is an up to date list of proxy servers:

http://www.digitalcybersoft.com/ProxyList/fresh-proxy-list.shtml

If your school has blocked proxy servers (like mine for instance) there is no possible way.

Anyways, you shouldn&#039;t be on Myspace etc at school. The school&#039;s computers are there for learning, not for Facebook MSN and what not.</Content>

            <Content>You have to go through a proxy otherwise you&#039;re going to have to hack your school&#039;s network and they&#039;re not going to be real happy with you if you do that.

Search for proxy servers on the net. There&#039;s plenty of them and tutorials out there but do be advised that any sysadmin worth their salt, which I&#039;m guessing most HS ones aren&#039;t since they&#039;re not paid enough, is going to block a proxy as soon as they discover it being used but you&#039;ll be able to use it for a bit.

Good luck!</Content>

            <Content>My favorite proxy to use is http://www.guardtunnel.com - works at my school.

It has like everything - Facebook/YouTube/MySpace support, SSL Encryption (very hard to block, and safe to use), not too many ads, and its really fast!  Plus it has an ad-free version that I use, you just gotta fill out a quick 2 minute survey - http://www.guardtunnel.com/ad-free/

Hope I helped you out!</Content>
