    <ChosenAnswer>because it&#039;s a memory hog, It depends on the pages you go to, a lot of them have so much dynamic content that it&#039;s constantly loading something or running animations, so it&#039;s not necessarily Internet explorers fault, you can blame the web developers also. because as internet speeds get faster, developers put more content on their site. and advertisements don&#039;t help either....lol</ChosenAnswer>
