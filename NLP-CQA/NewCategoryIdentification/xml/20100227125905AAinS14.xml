    <ChosenAnswer>I solved a similar problem on my machine. Hope this helps.

I have separate ADSL modem and wireless router. I noticed that by default both of their IP addresses were &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;. I thought this would create conflict situation. So, I changed the IP address of my wireless router to something different (eg: 192.168.1.20). You can do so by logging on to your router. And simply this solved my problem.
