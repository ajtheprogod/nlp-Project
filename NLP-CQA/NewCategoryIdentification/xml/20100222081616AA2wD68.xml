            <Content>This is your page on Howrse - http://www.howrse.com/joueur/fiche/?id=26759844
You need to post the link as if someone else was looking at it, so try to click on your own username if it&#039;s posted somewhere else on the site, otherwise the link you have provided will only take us back to our own page

? You don&#039;t own an EC though

The best way to get it started is to grow crops instead of taking in boarders - boarders do not bring in much profit at all. Even the cheaper, less fertile 15acre meadows will still bring in a lot more crop yield than the 100% fertile smaller ones due to the size. Grow flax in spring and wheat in summer. They will also help you get the more expensive meadows to grow on, which in turn will help for a scarecrow for each one so there will be even more crop yield, which in turn will help get the best boxes.
Get comps up and running - it will help with prestige. Most owners will set the skills of the comp to horses they own themselves. You can enter up to two of your own horses per comp anyway and this will help to get them running

Once you have enough, keep most of the next crop of flax for bedding then work on getting carrots and health mash. You need 30 carrots per box and 10 heath mash per box

In the mean time, buy as many droppings per day as you can, take them back to your meadows and turn into manure. Use what&#039;s needed for crops, then take the rest back to the store. There is a 40e profit per unit sold back to the store</Content>
