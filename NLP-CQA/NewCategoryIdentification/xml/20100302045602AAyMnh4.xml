    <ChosenAnswer>Your DSL Light is &quot;Stable light&quot; or &quot;Blinking Light&quot;? If blinking meant your ADSL Line is down but if stable but you cannot connect to net meant you have to look at 2 item as below :

1 ) Your username and password correct or not?
2 ) If username and password is correct, you have to contact ADSL provider and ask them to check your ADSL problem.</ChosenAnswer>
