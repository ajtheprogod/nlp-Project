  <Question id="20100222212057AAqBRj5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can sites charge your Internet bill without you knowing?</Subject>
    <Content>I had my friends over this weekend and I believe they went on an inappropriate site on my itouch. I think this because I opened safari and it came up to the site. At the top it said 1$ porn or something so I immediately backed out so it wouldn&#039;t charge me. My friends don&#039;t have access to our credit cards or anything so they coulding have done that. So could the site charge the 1$ or whatever to our Internet bill?
We have comcast. The itouch was off of wifi. The router is directly connected to the Internet/tv/phone box thing. I only say this because I googles this and it said if you have a land connection you are fine. But it wasn&#039;t very cler.

            <Content>Actually, they can and believe it&#039;s not being done without your knowledge. More often than not what happens is people just put a check in the box and agree to &quot;Terms of Agreement&quot; on a particular website without even bothering to read what it says. You would be surprised how many of the websites that offer &quot;Free&quot; stuff actually have a hidden cost. Have you ever heard the saying, &quot;there&#039;s no such thing as a free lunch!&quot;

If you have a wireless network setup at home you also should make sure that you have it secure, because if it isn&#039;t somebody can connect to it with either a computer or a mobile device and if they ring up any charges or do anything illegal guess who they will be coming looking for? You, that&#039;s who!

I would also secure your computer with a password, so that only you have access to it. And if you want to let others have access to it activate the Guest account, but restrict the access and what they can do on it.</Content>
