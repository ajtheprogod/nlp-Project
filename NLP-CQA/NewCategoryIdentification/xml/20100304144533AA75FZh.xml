  <Question id="20100304144533AA75FZh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I appear to be banned from a blogging site and know that I did not do anything to warrant it.?</Subject>
    <Content>The error message I receive is:

Forbidden
You were denied access because:
Access denied by access control list. 

The number 403 shows up on the bottom tab.  

I checked with my ISP and he went through a few things and a ban was the only other suggestion he could come up with.  I KNOW that I have not done anything to warrant a ban.  Also, I can access it through my BlackBerry so if I was banned, how could that happen?  I&#039;m totally baffled and need some help ASAP.  Thanks!

            <Content>403 sounds like the HTTP error code for &quot;forbidden&quot; (in other words access denied), so your IP address has probably been banned from the site. If you use a phone over a cellular network to access the site, it will not use the same IP and therefore not be banned.

I would recommend you talking to an administrator or moderator of the site and find out what had happened, and maybe resolve the problem.</Content>
