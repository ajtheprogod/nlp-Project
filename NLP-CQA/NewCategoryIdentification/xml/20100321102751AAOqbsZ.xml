  <Question id="20100321102751AAOqbsZ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Plastic Jungle: shipping?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve already mailed my things, I just wanna make sure that it was okay to put them in an envelope and seal the shipping label (with the prepaid stamp) on the envelope... And I shipped it 2 days ago, when should I expect to get my money in the mail. (Since I didn&#039;t choose the Amazon Gift Card, I get money right?)
Please help quickly!!!!

            <Content>Not enough info to answer your question.  I am assuming you are returning something.  If so, read on.  
  
Who did you buy it from, Amazon or one of the numerous sellers it represents?
How did you pay for it?  Cash? Credit card? Check?  
Where did you mail it from and where did you mail it to?
What postage rate (service) was on the shipping label?  Priority?

FYI:  If you paid with a credit card you will get a credit on your account.  If you paid by check or cash you will most likely get a check back, not cash.  If you paid by check you will not get anything back until your check clears the bank.</Content>
