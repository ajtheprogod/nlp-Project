    <ChosenAnswer>Nope. Considering how big the screen is (1024x768), using Cover Flow would pixelate your album art like crazy. Album art is usually 500x500.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Dont get a ipad it&#039;s just a giant itouch. There&#039;s a new device coming out called the Adam made by Notion Ink. It really is amazing and it completely blows away the ipad. See for yourself:

or
http://www.notionink.in/adamtechspecs.php

AND NO

I don&#039;t work for them and I&#039;m not a spammer. I just happen to think this is an amazing product which deserves a million times more attention than that POS ipad.</Content>
