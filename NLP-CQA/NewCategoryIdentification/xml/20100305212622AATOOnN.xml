  <Question id="20100305212622AATOOnN" type="Answered">
    <Subject>why don&#039;t my tweets show up on the public timeline?</Subject>
    <Content>On Twitter, when I post things, I can&#039;t ever see them on the public timeline. For example, if I use a tag like #iloveyou then search that tag, my tweet is never there. And I don&#039;t think my @replies go on there either. My twitter isn&#039;t locked so only people I follow can see, so I don&#039;t understand why it wouldn&#039;t show up. Any ideas?
#iloveyou was just an example. I make up my own hash tags, and then they&#039;re not in the timeline.

    <ChosenAnswer>The most probable reason is you are looking for your tweets in a busy hashtag (like #iloveyou) where several messages may have been posted while you posted a message and looked for it.

Try to search for #hashtag and your nickname and see if Twitter can locate the tweet for you.</ChosenAnswer>
