  <Question id="20100227123349AActfei" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How often is the member redemption for Lockerz?</Subject>
    <Content>I just saw one pass on the 25th, but I didn&#039;t bother to enter for it, since I didn&#039;t have enough points for anything nice and I just signed up a month ago.

So that makes me wondering, how often is the redemption?

And, if someone could add, is there any cost that I have to incur because of receiving the prize? (other than losing PTZ)

            <Content>I think lockerz don&#039;t work well, the all video is fake!

It will be better use this service: sonsoldi.it

The only services certainly working are on &quot;sonsoldi&quot;.</Content>

            <Content>Redemptions are once a month. This month is the first time there has been a member redemption, though.

And no, there is no extra cost you have to pay, unless you choose to join the member redemption.</Content>
