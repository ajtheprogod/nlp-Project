  <Question id="20100320140222AAwn4Ph" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does anyone know of a free web hosting service that lets me use python?</Subject>
    <Content>I don&#039;t need Django (it might be nice, but it&#039;s not necessary) but I don&#039;t want the provider to put ads on my page. I&#039;d like to be able to use Google Adsense and have my python scripts maintain the site (using mysql) but apart from that, I don&#039;t have any other requirements. Thanks for the help!
EDIT:  Also, I own several top level domains that I would like to use. I&#039;ve tried HelioHost, but it&#039;s terrible in terms of customer service and I don&#039;t plan on going back to them again. Thanks!
