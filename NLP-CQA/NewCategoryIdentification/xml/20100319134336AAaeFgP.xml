    <Subject>how to turn off ebay automatic seller fees?</Subject>
    <Content>i just signed up for ebay automatic seller fees and then realised i didnt want it but dont know how to stop it, it isnt really a big deal because i pay my seller fees as soon as i receive the money for an item i sold but im scared that at some point i will be charged and wont know what it was for.
