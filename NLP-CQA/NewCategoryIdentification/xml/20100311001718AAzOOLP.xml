    <ChosenAnswer>Sorry to hear that you got your phone stolen.

I think the phone company can figure that out by using triangulation.

If the person who stole your phone is using it, they can determine which repeaters are being accessed on the system and triangulate.

But even better is if the person who stole your phone is using it, all the phone numbers dialed will be recorded on the bill and if you have access to that, you can call these people and ask who has your phone.

I would stay away from Intelius.

Good luck.
