  <Question id="20100321125345AAkTaiw" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Hide my IP address, but live UK TV unavailable?</Subject>
    <Content>I use a &#039;Hide my IP address&#039; service to protect my PC from unauthorised access. I connect to ITV catchup TV and BBC iPlayer no problem but can no longer watch live TV as I used to. Do the TV companies now log all the IP addresses used by the &#039;Hide IP&#039; services so they can block their use? Or is there a live TV player service I can still use via &#039;Hide my IP address&#039;?

    <ChosenAnswer>I use a personal VPN, http://www.surfbouncer.com to both hide my IP and watch video and TV from all over the world. I hook into their US servers for Hulu and the TV networks and use the UK servers to watch iPlayer form overseas.</ChosenAnswer>
