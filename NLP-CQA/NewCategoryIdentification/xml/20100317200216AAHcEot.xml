    <ChosenAnswer>okay . there is a lot of pics on funny junk . 
but here is what you can do . if it is just a pic and not a whole web page . just open it up in an editor it should tell you. If it is part of a web page open it up in html editor like front page . it will be in the html code but most likely take some looking to find it .</ChosenAnswer>
