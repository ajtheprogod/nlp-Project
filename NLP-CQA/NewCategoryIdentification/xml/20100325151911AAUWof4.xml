  <Question id="20100325151911AAUWof4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Has anyone here wrote or is writing for eHow?</Subject>
    <Content>I just started and I want to know if you really make money doing it. I am not really looking for a work at home job but I wanted to start writing in my free time and I ran across eHow. It stated that it pays. I read everything about how it works but I would like to hear from someone that has or is doing this. How much to do you make every month and how long did it take to reach that?
