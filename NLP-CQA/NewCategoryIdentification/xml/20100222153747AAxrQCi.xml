  <Question id="20100222153747AAxrQCi" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What happened to imeem?? Does anyone know any other sites similar to it?</Subject>
    <Content>Apparently imeem is now myspace music, but myspace sucks and I hate it. Since the switch, I lost all the music from my playlists, and myspace doesn&#039;t even have half the music imeem used to. Anyone know any other good sites similar to the old imeem?

Thanks a lot! :)
