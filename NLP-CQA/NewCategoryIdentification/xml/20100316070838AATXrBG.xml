            <Content>It does not have to be the exact postage. Charge what you feel is appropriate for packing and shipping. first, be sure that you&#039;re charging enough for the postage itself. I always add a few dollars for packaging and the 8 mile round trip to post office. packing can be pricey. however, you can play this many ways. figure the shipping cost and bury it in minimum selling price is nice because then you can advertise &#039;free shipping&#039;....  only the big sellers who do high volume go by zip code to figure price. I just received an item from ebay where I paid $5 shipping - when the package arrived, it had $2 postage - which is fair for small volume sellers.  if you don&#039;t want to sell overseas, include that in your ad.</Content>
