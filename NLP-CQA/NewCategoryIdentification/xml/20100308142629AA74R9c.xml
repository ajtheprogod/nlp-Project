    <ChosenAnswer>Make and model number of the router would have helped...

Go to the manufacturer&#039;s web site and see if there is a firmware update for your router.

Instead of resetting it, next time try just pulling the power plug for a moment and then plugging it back in.</ChosenAnswer>
