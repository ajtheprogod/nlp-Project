    <ChosenAnswer>Unless you have access to their e-mail account, there is no way to tell whether your message has been read or not. If a person gets a lot of mail and doesn&#039;t want to mess with all the messages, he or she can mark them all as &quot;Read or &quot;Unread.&quot; So the only way to know would be to talk to the person in question, and ask if they have received your message. Or, you may send out a &quot;Test&quot; message, and set the perameters of your account so that when your message is opened/read, the other person&#039;s account will send a confirmation that they have opened your message.</ChosenAnswer>
