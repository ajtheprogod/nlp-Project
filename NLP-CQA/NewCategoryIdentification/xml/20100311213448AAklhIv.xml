    <ChosenAnswer>There are no codes for March 2010

The original promo codes were last in circulation around December 2008. The ones that have been on the cards had their own individual number and were a one time use only - they had to be bought from Howrse. The card packs have also been long since sold out

Anything you find on cheat sites or even here on Y!A are either old or fake, which is why they aren&#039;t working.</ChosenAnswer>
