    <Subject>How do I know if this is real? Should I trust it?</Subject>
    <Content>So there is a thing on facebook to get a free $250 IKEA gift card. Yes, most of the comments say they actually got the gift card and its real. But when I gave my email, I got a like to another website to get a free prize:

Is this real? Should I trust it?  I know it sounds stupid, but Im just making sure.

            <Content>You should use Firefox, with the web of trust add-on. And yes it&#039;s a scam. Anything on the internet and email that offers free money, is 99% a scam.

Here is the web of trust rating for that site:

            <Content>My dear, the card is probably real, but what you&#039;ll have to do to get it probably isn&#039;t worth the trouble. Most of these things promise to give so great gift like a credit card, shopping spree or a new laptop. What you find later is you&#039;ll be asked to sign up for a trial offer or make a purchase of some kind before you receive it. Remember, nothing is ever free in life. Don&#039;t believe me then go ahead and continue on the site. At some point you&#039;ll be asked about your needs for a service. Insurance, movie rentals, etc. To me not worth the time and hassle.

Hope this is helpful. I am speaking from experience. These marketing tools are just that to get you to buy something you probably didn&#039;t want to buy just because you want to get something for free.</Content>
