    <ChosenAnswer>Try these 100% totally free sites as they are more or less strictly UK, compared to other sites that are based in USA or include majority of members from other parts of the world. But I think for UK locality the Plentyoffish site has a better selection, although Connectinsingles has much more fun stuff to do other than just look for a date.</ChosenAnswer>
