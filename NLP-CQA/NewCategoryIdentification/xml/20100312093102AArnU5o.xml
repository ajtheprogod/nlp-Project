            <Content>you would need to purchase the domain.
.tk domains are free, curtecy of the adds which as a result get placed on your site.
.com, .net, .info, .biz, .org, and many other . domains are personal and comercial, thus meaning that they need to be purchased. You own the rights to that domain as long as your lease lasts. Typically you renew them each year.

Domains are registered by what&#039;s called a registrar. My domain is registered, for instance, by droa (domain registry of America)

It appears that abcd.com  is already taken by an anime review website, though I might be wrong - didn&#039;t take  that close of a look at the website. If the domain is for sale, you can purchase it. Otherwise, unless you personally talked to the site owner (and probably paid a large sum of money), they own the domain.</Content>
