    <ChosenAnswer>On speedtest.net you can compare your results and view how you do against people in your area, country, the rest of the world and by ISP too.

I would say your results are pretty poor, I would expect 8mb down and 1mb up to be more the standard.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It depends. If you&#039;re supposed to have a 1Mbs connection, then that&#039;s a good result. If you&#039;re supposed to have 7Mbs, then it isn&#039;t.</Content>
