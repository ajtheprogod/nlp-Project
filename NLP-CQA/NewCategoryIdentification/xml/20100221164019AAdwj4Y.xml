    <ChosenAnswer>There is nothing pornographic, illegal, or &quot;perverted&quot; about that website.  The company can&#039;t control responses to its products (any more than companies selling women&#039;s lingerie or swimsuits can), and has a right to show its products, on the reasonable and intelligent assumption that most customers are not sex offenders but rather perfectly normal people looking for cute underwear for their kids.

The fact that you labeled this site &quot;perverted&quot; makes me wonder about you.  Have you never seen old Sears, Roebuck and Montgomery Ward catalogues?  Have you never seen catalogues selling kids&#039; swimsuits?  There is no nudity here, no sex, and how are companies supposed to sell their products if they have to worry about the nutcases who might find these non-nude and non-sexual photos titillating -- AND about people like you and Harley Drive, who claim that they are &quot;perverted&quot;?

There are plenty of truly sick child pornographers out there, people who photograph children nude and in forced sexual situations.  Worry about them, not about cute kids&#039; underwear sites.</ChosenAnswer>
