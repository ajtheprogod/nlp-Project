  <Question id="20100222024058AAHc5h4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Would making a political social networking site be a worthwhile endeavor?</Subject>
    <Content>I am a college student in the computer science field, and I am looking to create a political social networking site. I realize that there are already good sites like this, and also, alot of people use Facebook as a way to network politically. Well, my goal is to make a site good enough that either it could stand alone, or be bought by one of the other major sites. I know this is unlikely, but I just wanted to get some feedback from people with either experience in large-scale web dev or just want to weigh in on the idea itself.

Thanks.

    <ChosenAnswer>what the hell give it a shot. Try and make that you can show both sides If you follow politics and people you know there are a lot of misinformation going on and people flat refuse to look for the truth in anything they just accept what is said. If not it&#039;s still good way to hone your skills. If your Republican or Democrat the common folks need to see what&#039;s going on in a impartial way. For example Glen Beck and Limbaugh are shown to pass out some evil and untrue things and if that&#039;s all you listen to that&#039;s all you get,</ChosenAnswer>
