    <ChosenAnswer>If the payment method is via Click-bank they tend to have a 60 day refund policy no questions asked.  I recently bought 2 courses off the net and paid via credit card through click-bank and found they were not what I really wanted so claimed my money back.  All was refunded within a couple of days.</ChosenAnswer>
