  <Question id="20100301185713AAcMiDS" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why can&#039;t I send an AIM message to someone&#039;s cell from my cell?</Subject>
    <Content>Every time I try to send an AIM Instant Message to someone who is &quot;mobile&quot;, it says &quot;System Msg: User is not logged in&quot;.

However, I get on my computer before AND after trying to send them this message, and on my AIM on my computer, it says they are &quot;mobile&quot; and I can send them messages just fine, and I can receive messages from them just fine as well.

Will entering my &quot;mobile&quot; onto AIM help change this? Or are they just trying to sell me some product or service?
