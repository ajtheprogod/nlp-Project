  <Question id="20100308193724AAhX1gf" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why is it that forums and message boards are full of snobbish, bitter, angry people?</Subject>
    <Content>And this means any forum that I go to. Even the Ultimate-Guitar and GameFAQs forums. One day, I posted a topic about my brother&#039;s opinions, and guess what? Almost every poster there flamed my brother. And me. Also, other people there who posted their own opinions got their flames.

I said. &quot;I don&#039;t deserve to get flamed here, that opinion is not mine!&quot; but they still said, &quot;you do, because you posted it.&quot;

It seems like no matter who makes that post, these angry people just won&#039;t stop making any degrading comments about them.

Why don&#039;t people get along well on forums such as these? Why don&#039;t they just say things respectfully?
