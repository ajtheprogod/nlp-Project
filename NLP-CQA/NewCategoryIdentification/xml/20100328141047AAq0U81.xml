    <Subject>how many itmes does Lockerz have during a redemtion?</Subject>
    <Content>hi, i was wandering how many items do they put in for each amount of items... ( so like do they put in 100 ipod touches, 500 ipod touches or what?) 
also since they dont tell when the redemption is anymore, how could you find out when it is?

thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>They don&#039;t tell us that information, on how many items they put out. But i&#039;m thinking its only a couple hundred, since they are gone so fast and they have millions of members. There is no telling when you can find out when redemption, sometimes they tell us, and sometimes they don&#039;t. But you just have to keep checking yourself.....which sucks.  =[</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Hey , No one know the exact amount of prizes , They restock on random dates and times , I suggest you to use LockerzAlerts service http://www.lockerzalerts.com they will send you text message to your mobile phone when the redemption will occur so you wont miss it - Its FREE.</Content>
