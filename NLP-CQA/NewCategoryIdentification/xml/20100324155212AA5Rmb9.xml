    <ChosenAnswer>It depends on what name they used when they created the email address. Not everybody tells the truth when creating an email address. Personally I use at least 6 different email addresses. One which is purely for personal use and never gets posted anywhere on any sites. Others are used for sites requiring a point of contact like YA, Facebook, internet forums etc and none of those can easily be traced back to me or to my home address. There is a fairly good &quot;people search&quot; engine which can be found here: http://www.ehow.com/tag/pipl.com/

            <Content>If it&#039;s to do with yahoo answers, then click their name. If not, then there is no way of searching their name and finding their email address. Sorry about that</Content>
