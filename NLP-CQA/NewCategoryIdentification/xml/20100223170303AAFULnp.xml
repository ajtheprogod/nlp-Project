  <Question id="20100223170303AAFULnp" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Formspring hasn&#039;t been working?</Subject>
    <Content>When I try logging on, it says &quot; Oops, We are working on getting the site back up as fast as possible. Please wait a few min and try again.&quot;
But it has been like this for the past week.
When I have miraculously logged on, It does not let me respond to my questions.
Some sort of error message pops up.
Am i alone?
