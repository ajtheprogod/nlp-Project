  <Question id="20100303184314AANuTpS" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Scrolling seems a little buggy in Firefox 3.6?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m using FireFox 3.6, and scrolling, highlighting text, and even typing seems to be a little bit slow.

It works fine for about a minute, but then there&#039;s like 1 or 2 seconds where the whole application just freezes.
Sometimes it&#039;s the whole Firefox application, but other times it&#039;s simply the website I&#039;m browsing.

Anyone else having a similar problem?

    <ChosenAnswer>ZOMG. I thought it was just me!!! The left-click on my laptop is a little wonky, and I have a USB modem, so I thought it was my clicker and connection. It&#039;s really frustrating when I&#039;m on deviantART or Bloodlines on FB and all of the sudden it all freezes. *JIGGLYPUFF ANGRY FACE!!!*</ChosenAnswer>
