    <Subject>Can you ask an eBay seller to hold an item for you?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi:
I want this laptop really badly, and I wanted to know if you could send an eBay message to the seller asking him or her to hold the item for me until May, when I will have the money available?
Thanks!

            <Content>Look, you can always ask, but be prepared for the seller to say no. Why should he hold it for you until May if he can sell it right now?</Content>

            <Content>Sure you could ask them, but I don&#039;t believe that is a viable ebay option. Good luck!</Content>

            <Content>You could ask, but they will probably say no. Why would they hold it when they could sell it now. Maybe if you offer them more money they&#039;ll do it for you.</Content>

            <Content>LOL ! ! !  People list items to make money. May is a long way off.

If you win the item and the seller has been paid, it is possible seller might hold off shipping to you. 

You can find the same item listed when you have the money. 

Most sellers are not stores that have inventories of merchandise. They are individuals who need to make sales as quickly as possible. Why should anyone hold an item that you have not paid for?  Suppose someone agreed to do that and you never paid them???? 

You have to put yourself in their position.</Content>

            <Content>It doesn&#039;t hurt to ask, and he could possibly say yes if he has more than one. I have done it before where I have held an item for a buyer. However, if he only has the one laptop. probably no. Plus, I have noticed that 80% of the time I agree to hold an item, a buyer never comes back to pay for it. No point in risking that if you can just sell an item now.</Content>
