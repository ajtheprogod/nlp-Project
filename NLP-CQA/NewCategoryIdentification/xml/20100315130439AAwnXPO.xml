  <Question id="20100315130439AAwnXPO" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Website that allows people to see what&#039;s on your screen?</Subject>
    <Content>I was shown a link to a website that lets you watch what other people do on their computer screen, it sounds stalkerish, I know. But it was really interesting because you could hear their music and what they said, along with a small chat box so that you could write to them.
I liked the website because I draw digital art, and like to have feedback from people while I draw. I can&#039;t remember the website though, and am still searching for the site!
Can Anyone help me?
You can&#039;t control what happens on the person&#039;s screen, and you can only go on their screen if the person is registered and says that it&#039;s ok to have people go on.
I know for sure it exists, and it&#039;s not &#039;logmein&#039;, I have been on it twice now but can&#039;t find the server D:

            <Content>its logmein.com but this website lets you remote operate any computer in the world through internet but for that you need to have the other computer added on to your logmein.com account for which you need their authorization once and after that you can do that so make the long story short there is no way you can see some one else computer without their authorization in a legal way</Content>
