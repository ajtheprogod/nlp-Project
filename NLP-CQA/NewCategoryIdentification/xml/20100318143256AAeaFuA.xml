  <Question id="20100318143256AAeaFuA" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Hey, anyone heard of this hoax?</Subject>
    <Content>OK, so i got an email from a friend, and everything was similar, like her name was spelled correctly, they typed just like her, etc etc, except they  changed her email address. they took her email address (let&#039;s just say it&#039;s sbbubbles@gmail) and changed it so it looked the same, but wasn&#039;t hers. (changed to: sbbuubbles@gmail) and so the message came in as  &quot;sally brownwell&quot; but it wasn&#039;t her email. it claimed she was in the UK (which i happen to know Sally isn&#039;t), and was mugged and her money, both cash and credit, and her cell phone, which is why she was emailing me, because she needed help.

well, obviously i didn&#039;t give them anything. Sally&#039;s personal life is not one that would let her go to England, as well as get mugged. So i know this is obviously a hoax.

anyone know anything about a hoax like this, or gotten one like it? cause i&#039;d love to know, otherwise i think it&#039;s sally being a witch (distinct possibility)

thanks
