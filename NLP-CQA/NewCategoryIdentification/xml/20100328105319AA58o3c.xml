    <ChosenAnswer>Usually you have to fill out tons of surveys and make purchases to receive coupons, so it&#039;s not that it&#039;s actually free in a sense of not having to do anything. You&#039;ll also notice that you&#039;ll get a huge amount of unwanted email. I&#039;ve had curiosities about sites like this, but all the surveys and pop ups and emails were so annoying that I gave up. If you want free stuff, try entering sweepstakes.</ChosenAnswer>
