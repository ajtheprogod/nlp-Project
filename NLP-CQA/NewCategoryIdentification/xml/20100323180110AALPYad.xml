    <Subject>New to Firefox - the look of it just changed on my computer?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve only been using FF 3.5.8 on WinXP for about a week, but one thing I did like about it was that it let me see the different tabs/websites that I had open at a time.  Suddenly, now, I see that the tabs are not visible anymore and when I click the &quot;X&quot; up in the right-top corner, the page shuts down and doesn&#039;t ask me if I want to close out of FF anymore.  It just closes.  How can I reset it so I see the tabs again?  I made many other changes, so I don&#039;t really want to do a System Restore.  TIA.
Thanks!!  Works like it used to.  You were all correct - I&#039;ll wait till I can close this answer and then pick the first one as best answer.  (!)
Oh, not quite the same yet.  I did what you all said, but I still only see one tab, and a different URL in my address bar (on top).  I&#039;d like to see two tabs, to see what I have open.  Now I can only see the one I&#039;m on.  How can I do this? (thanks again)
&#039;Guess what I&#039;m asking is, how do I see multiple tabs (at top) when I have multiple windows open, so I can switch back and forth between them easily?

    <ChosenAnswer>There&#039;s an option to show the tabs even when only a single website is open.  Here&#039;s how to set it:

1. Click the Tools-&gt;Options menu item.
2. Click the Tabs page.
3. Check the &quot;Always show the Tab bar&quot; checkbox.
4. Click OK.

Hope that helps.</ChosenAnswer>
