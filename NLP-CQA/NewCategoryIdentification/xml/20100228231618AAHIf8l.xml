  <Question id="20100228231618AAHIf8l" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is it fair for Vodafone UK to do this (mobile broadband)?</Subject>
    <Content>Vodafone USB dongles have a connection speed of 7mbps if you&#039;re on a plan (contract) but only half that (3.5mbps) if you&#039;re on prepay.  Although Vodafone is currently the only UK provider to offer 7mbps, it seems unfair for them to deny prepay users that speed.

    <ChosenAnswer>Yes it&#039;s fair; because they&#039;re the only one with that incentive, unless another competitor can match it up, like O2, or something, Vodafone dictates unfortunately.

Oh and by the way, I know 2 users shouldn&#039;t have more than one account; but come on, you need to help me bypass it.</ChosenAnswer>
