  <Question id="20100226114000AALM5zD" type="Answered">
    <Subject>My wireless freezes and disconnects, Why?</Subject>
    <Content>Whenever i play online multiplayer games such as , mabinogi , maplestory , gunz , etc. 
At some random time, the game freezes, and whenever the game freezes i know that my wireless
has been frozen , and disconnected. I don&#039;t know why this happens. My brother has the router on his computer, and wheneve he plays games, he never disconnects. Im using the wirless usb, (D-Link), and im RIGHT beside my brother and the game still disconnects. Does this happen to people too? Or is something wrong with my computer, or wireless, OR SOMETHING? D:
HELP PLEASE.

            <Content>1) Something might be interfering with the wireless signal.
  2) Something is wrong with your driver (software that allows hardware like routers and printers to work properly)
  3) Defective wireless usb (get it exchanged and see if the problem persists)</Content>
