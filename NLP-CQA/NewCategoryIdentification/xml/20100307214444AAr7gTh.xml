    <Subject>Switching ISP question? ATT to Comcast?</Subject>
    <Content>Currently, I live in the 95121 area, using ATT DSL at 150Kb/s for $25/mo
I want to upgrade to Comcast economy high speed cable at 1Mbps for $25/mo

Now I went to the comcast website to see their services. at the bottom of the specs list, it said this is the starting price for those already subscribed to comcast&#039;s other services. But since i use ATT for phone services, I want to switch to comcast for the internet, will I be able to do this? And what does it mean by starting prices for those already subscribed, because I saw no label saying anything was the starting price, just a flat out price of 24.99/mo.

Just to get to the point, I want to switch from ATT internet to Comcast with the description from the first paragraph. Will i have problems?

    <ChosenAnswer>You will not have a problem, You can just have the phone service with your AT&amp;T provider, and also Comcast is good, it is the same price for pretty much x10 the speed you are getting now. Just call your AT&amp;T provider and tell them to cancel your internet service.</ChosenAnswer>
