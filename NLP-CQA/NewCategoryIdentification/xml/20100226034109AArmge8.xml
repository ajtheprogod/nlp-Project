    <Subject>Streaming live video windows bases flash or other?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m trying to stream live video of an event to a network device for digital signage, i&#039;ve tried windows media encoder and it works fine but is limited to 4 connections and I have 13. We don&#039;t have a flash server so can&#039;t try that. I was just wondering if anybody knows any other software or way to stream live video to an ip address as I have to point it at a network address in order for it to work.
Thank in advance for your suggestions

they all let you stream.

if you have a free programme like manycam you can also add adverts or a watermark to your streams

I use them for streaming live sports and events and they work very well.
