            <Content>WHEN DOES MARCH RADNESS START AND END?
March Radness begins on March 8, 2010 at 6 PM Eastern and ends on March 25, 2010 at 11:59 PM Eastern.
WHEN WILL YOU ANNOUNCE THE WINNER?
We will announce the winning team by March 26. However, Anthony and Dave will keep you updated during the dailies between now and then!
CAN I CHOOSE MY TEAM?
If you are in the U.S., you are on the U.S. team. If you are in any other country, you are on Team International. Please make sure your country is listed in your account settings.
HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THE WINNER?
The winning team will be the team that earns the most PTZ during March Radness.
HOW DO YOU EARN PTZ TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES?
The quickest way to earn PTZ is through watching videos in PLAY (and, of course, Z-listers earn double PTZ for watching)! You can also earn PTZ in all the other ways: logging in daily, inviting friends, and answering the dailies.
WHAT ARE THE RULES OF MARCH RADNESS?
All of our usual rules and Terms of Use apply.
WHAT WILL THE WINNING TEAM RECEIVE?
The winning team--and only the winning team--will participate in Marchâ€™s redemption.
WHEN IS THE REDEMPTION?

            <Content>They restock in random date and time. they announced that this month will be surprise redemption.

My recommendation to you is to use LockerzAlerts http://www.lockerzalerts.com this service will send you text messages to you mobile phone when the redemption occurs - Its also FREE !


Good luck on the redemption !</Content>
