    <Subject>Second Life as a virtual world is it stagnating, dying or growing?</Subject>
    <Content>Second Life, is it stagnating, dying or growing?
I’m thinking about investing some money in second life because I believe virtual worlds are just getting going.
However I’m uncertain about the future of Second life as a whole.
Any thoughts?

    <ChosenAnswer>It is just beginning to grow, second life has made it on cnn.com a few times. Cnn will even broadcast Second Life elections and political meetings. Second life has no where to go but up. I have seen a lot of growth in the past 2 years and a lot of people still have no idea about the site :)
