    <Subject>Can someone find you by picture?</Subject>
    <Content>I was very skeptical of a site called &quot;chatroulette&quot; where you can vid with people. i was stupid and decided to try it out. well i got paired with a perv older man who was jacking off on camera! I&#039;ve been to all of those internet safety classes and stuff, but am really creeped out by this. Could he find my from a pic of my face and hunt me down? I&#039;m very nervous. I know I should&#039;nt have gone on that site...

    <ChosenAnswer>there&#039;s a yes, and a no. Yes people can find you by picture on chatroulette map, but it&#039;s only if your on chatroulette at the time. i know this because i cant find my pic when I&#039;m offline. chatroulette map is a map of everyone who is online, but you have to click on the location to view the pic. so don&#039;t worry, there&#039;s more than 20,000 users a day, so going through every country, then state, then city, then street address just to see your picture would be a waste of time. just relax, if you didn&#039;t tell anyone where your from, then your safe. EDIT:: your picture does stay up there even offline, i hate to be the bringer of bad news but i just saw my pic and I&#039;m not on chatroulette, but again trying to search through everywhere just to find your pic is ridiculous so again you really don&#039;t have anything to worry about.

chatroulette is supposed to be a fun place, but unfortunately its turned very sour and gross.</ChosenAnswer>
