    <Subject>Internet Browsers not working!!?</Subject>
    <Content>I was just online not more than 15 mins ago and IE was working perfectly. I closed the windows and restarted my computer because Firefox had messed up (like usual) and now NEITHER of my web browsers will work. I click on them and it looks like they&#039;re going to work and then it just doesn&#039;t do a thing! I have no clue what is going on. Im connected to the internet. I can get on my messengers I can open my anti-virus software. but its just the web browsers that arent working! Please help :(
I am obviously on a different computer for those of you who do not have brains... I am on my families desktop computer and it is my laptop that is not working

    <ChosenAnswer>If your internet explorer is messing up, you probably have some sort of spyware on your computer. I&#039;d try running Malwarebytes&#039; Anti-Malware. You can get it from http://www.filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/ 

if you would like to reset your internet explorer to it&#039;s default settings, press the windows button and r on he keyboard and  type &quot;inetcpl.cpl&quot; into the run command that shows up. Once there, click the advanced tab and then click the reset button to reset internet explorer to the default settings.</ChosenAnswer>
