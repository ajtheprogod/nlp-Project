    <Subject>Sounds that make dogs excited?</Subject>
    <Content>I need to find some sounds that make dogs excited but i can&#039;t seem to find any. Its just that my dog seem bored but nothing seems to cheer him up and I was hoping some sounds for dogs would help.

    <ChosenAnswer>Dogs are predators and, by nature, can be excited by the sound(s) of prey animals (rabbits, mice, etc.) - especially such animals in distress. That&#039;s why squeak toys are so popular for dogs. They mimic the sound of a small animal screaming for it&#039;s life. They are also excited by the sound of other dogs.

You can probably find different animal sounds, including birds, dogs growling, small animal calls through a web search.  Search for sound effects or animal sounds.</ChosenAnswer>
