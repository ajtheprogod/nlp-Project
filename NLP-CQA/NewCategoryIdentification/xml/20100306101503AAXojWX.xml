            <Content>I had the some problem. You should back up your bookmarks by going to Bookmarks, Organize Bookmarks, Backup and Import, Backup. Save that file and now uninstall firefox. When you reinstall it go to File, import to restore your Bookmarks. If you dont backup your bookmarks when you uninstall they will be gone.</Content>
