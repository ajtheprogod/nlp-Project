    <ChosenAnswer>Stumbleupon is a relaxing pastime and comes up with some of the most fasinating sites and you can just keep hitting stumble or you can fill out a section where you get to say what your interested in and it will target those sites.Also you can create your own page like facebook etc but much more scope for decorating your site.Heres the link~~

            <Content>If you want some laughs at the expense of others:
www.break.com

If you want some funny webcomics: 
www.cad-comic.com
www.amazingsuperpowers.com
www.explosm.net

If you want a newish networking site with games and stickers and all that sparkly crap:
www.myyearbook.com

If you want to never ever see the sun again, lose all respect for humanity, and eventually become a self-proclaimed despot of society... www.4chan.org/b/ 
I warn you... if you go there, you will only have a few weeks before you can never return to normalcy. Also, screw rules 1 and 2! Also also, the game.</Content>
