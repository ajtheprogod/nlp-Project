  <Question id="20100317042256AAhH9dY" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does anyone know if the Website Lockerz is a scam?</Subject>
    <Content>A buddy invited me to it, and I don&#039;t know if it truly works. (They&#039;re out of everything atm). It seems to me like it would because of the mandatory advertisements, they must make a lot of money. Anyone ever receive a prize from them or know if it works?

Just curious before I spend the next day earning points that are useless.

ty in advance

    <ChosenAnswer>Lockerz is a real company. It is funded by Liberty Media, one of the largest media companies in the US. The Chief Executive Officer of Lockerz is Kathy Savitt, a former executive at Amazon.com and American Eagle Outfitters.

Here&#039;s how it work:
Lockerz uses PTZ, its currency unit.

Lockerz members earn PTZ by answering daily question (+2 PTZ) and clicking &quot;log in&quot; (+2PTZ) everyday.
They can also earn more PTZ by watching video in PLAY section (+2 PTZ per video).
And when they invite someone to join Lockerz, they earn PTZ for this (+2 PTZ per accepted invite)..
If they invite 20 people and more, they get Z-Lister title, it&#039;s mean they get double PTZ for their activities (answer daily question, log in, watch video, invite someone... +4 PTZ).

What&#039;s PTZ used to do?
Every month, Lockerz hold a redeem day (usually at the end of month) and you can use your PTZ to redeem prizes. There&#039;re a lot of prizes (Macbook, Iphone, Ipod, Ipad, xbox360, cash...), you can go to REDEEM section for more.

That&#039;s what I know about Lockerz!

            <Content>At a guess it&#039;s a  Pyramid Scheme scam fraud ... 

The only way to &#039;make&#039; anything from such scams is to suck in more mugs ... (this is why your mate sent you an &#039;invite&#039; no doubt :-) )</Content>
