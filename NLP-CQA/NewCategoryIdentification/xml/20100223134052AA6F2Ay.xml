    <Subject>Good Internet Browser which ISN&#039;T FireFox, IE8, Opera, Chrome, or Safari?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a Windows 7 computer, and spend a lot of  time on the internet, most especially -forums, chatbox, and Facebook.  I also do online writing in an RPG.

I like the look and features of FireFox (and opera for that matter) HOWEVER, neither one of them work well on my computer.  FireFox locks up a lot and opera isn&#039;t very &quot;quality looking&quot; for some reason.  I don&#039;t like Chrome because it is so simple.  I have IE8 but it likewise locks up and I hate it.  I&#039;m not big on Safari either.

What else is there that is a good browser?  My favorite features of FireFox are things like: spell check, remembering passwords, saving tabs, SPEED DIAL.

Hope someone can help :)

    <ChosenAnswer>Looks like you&#039;re left with Maxthon then, most of the other alternatives are &#039;lite&#039; versions that make Chrome look sophisticated

It&#039;s a bit too busy for my liking and it uses the IE core, but it has many fans</ChosenAnswer>
