    <ChosenAnswer>Yes, you definitely can. In the package your product came in there is a receipt. Near the bottom there will be a phrase like &quot;Need to return an item? Visit www.amazon.com/returns.&quot; You go to that page and you&#039;ll see your recent orders and you can click on which item you want to return. You select a brief reason why you need to return it and then you can print out the return shipping label that is prepaid by Amazon along with a return merchandise authorization form telling Amazon when they receive the package that it was an authorized return.

So you just put the RMA into the box with the product in relative condition to when you received it and tape the shipping label onto the outside of the package (on the top, over the previous shipping label from when it was shipped to you) and take it to the nearest UPS store to have it shipped back free of charge.

Amazon notifies you when the return has been received and they credit your credit card.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It would depend on what you bought and/or how long ago you bough it. Here is a link to Amazon&#039;s Return Policy:
