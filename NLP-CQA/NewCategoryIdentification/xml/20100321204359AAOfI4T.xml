  <Question id="20100321204359AAOfI4T" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Has anyone actually used www.oohilove.com?</Subject>
    <Content>I saw an ad for the site www.oohilove.com its one of those auction sites that start bids below a dollar with expensive items. I thought about signing up but it seems pretty unreal to me. Has anyone used it and had success? or Any opinions on these sorts of sites?
