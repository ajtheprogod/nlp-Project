            <Content>well its highly against the rules setting out by jarex, so you account could be banned if you try and sell it.there is lots of sites that will review your character and they buy it and put a markup on it.
eg http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=selling+runescape+account&amp;meta=&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;oq=selling+runescape+</Content>

            <Content>selling accounts is againt the rules of jagex, but you could go on gold4rs.com and sell your account there. the ammount of money you would get also depends on your skill levels. hope this helped.</Content>
