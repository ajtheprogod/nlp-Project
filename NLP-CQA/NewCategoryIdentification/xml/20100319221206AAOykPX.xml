    <Subject>Server hosting service providers with WordPress ; fully functional condition without errors.?</Subject>
    <Content>Hello everyone !

I want to know about server hosting service providers in English.

Because I want to open my blog sites with WordPress.

Requires that the following conditions are met.

1. A very low fee.
2. Common Linux OS such as CentOS. (Not Windows server)
3. User can set wordpress freely.
4. Fully functional condition without errors about using WordPress. (very important point !)
5. Perl, PHP and other things without restrictions.
5. The trial period for free
6. Visa card available
7. Provides better support for using e-mail

I am a Japanese living in Japan, so very poor English :-(

Please reply in simple English, if possible with URL.

Thank you ;-)
