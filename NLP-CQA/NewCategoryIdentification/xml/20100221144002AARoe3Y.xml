            <Content>If talking to the seller on the phone does not resolve the problem , go to: eBay, and start a dispute. There is also a link to a report a problem on your eBay Item watch page. 
You have to open a dispute within 60 days of the end of the auction, and eBay will close the dispute at 90 days whether it is resolved or not.

            <Content>there is not really alot you can do but report the seller to ebay and open a dispute.but doesn&#039;t usually get anywhere as often the seller will just close his account with ebay and then there is nothing you can do then. the only way that you can protect yourself on ebay is to make sure to check the feedback of the seller thoroughly.if they have too many negatives i normally give them a miss.</Content>
