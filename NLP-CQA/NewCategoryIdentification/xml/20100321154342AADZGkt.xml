    <ChosenAnswer>Technically, it&#039;s like a discussion room. People talk about different things in forums. Depending on the site, it can be music, games, shows, movies, etc. They really aren&#039;t anything that special. They&#039;re just message boards. People even ask questions in forums and others can give their opinion. It is sort of like yahoo answers, but slightly different.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If you are talking about an internet forum, it&#039;s just an area on the internet to chat with one another.  A forum will usually be in the form of a message board, where you can post a question or comment and someone can respond.  Hmm....sounds familiar?

Forums will always have a theme or topic, such as computers, cars, hobbies, etc.</Content>
