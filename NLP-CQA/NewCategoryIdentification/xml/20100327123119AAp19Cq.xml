    <ChosenAnswer>Firstly, try deleting all your cookies, you can usually do this in your browser option, if that doesn&#039;t work download a new browser or reinstall the one you have now, then get yourself a good anti-virus like AVG or Avira Anti-Vir to stop malware from infecting your browser. By the way that&#039;s most likely your problem, you have malware or a virus on your computer sending you to sites you don&#039;t want to go.</ChosenAnswer>
