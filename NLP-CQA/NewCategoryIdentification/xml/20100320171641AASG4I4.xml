    <ChosenAnswer>Depends on what u use the email address for.  If it&#039;s just for pleasure and membership at various websites, then it&#039;s fine.  I use my yahoo email address all over the net.  But it has not personal information connected with it.

For business transactions, banking and such I would keep a separate email address that I would not share anywhere on the net.</ChosenAnswer>
