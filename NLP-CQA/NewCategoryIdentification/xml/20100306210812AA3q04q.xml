    <ChosenAnswer>If you go into Device Manager (searchable froms Start Menu), and look under Network Adapters, you should find all the adapters that your computer uses to connect to a network. Find the one most related to wireless (eg. WiFi, AGN, AG, 54 etc) and check that it is functioning properly. If nothing is there relating to wireless, then the computer has not detected the wireless card and that can be an issue. If it says something about an issue, try re-installing the driver and reboot your computer. Sometimes it can be as simple as checking the wireless On/Off switch (I know it sounds dumb, but we&#039;ve all done it before). Good luck</ChosenAnswer>
