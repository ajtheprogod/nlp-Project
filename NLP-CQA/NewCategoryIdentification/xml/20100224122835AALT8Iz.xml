  <Question id="20100224122835AALT8Iz" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is Points2Shop for real? What is the catch?</Subject>
    <Content>I am thinking about joining it but I don&#039;t want to join a site that won&#039;t work. I also don&#039;t have a credit card, because I&#039;m young so can I still do things on there to earn a reasonable amount of points? Would I still be able to buy expensive things like an iPod Touch? Is it worth it?

    <ChosenAnswer>You don&#039;t need a credit card and you can do anything you want on the site, you only have to be 13 to join. And yes they have many ipod touch&#039;s always in stock. 

Points2shop is by far the best site for earning free cash/prizes. I&#039;ve been a member of all the get free stuff websites: Prizerebel, Swagbucks, Lockerz, Rewards1, and cashcrate. They were all really hard to earn points on. It was very time consuming. And I never got anything from those sites.

If I were you I&#039;d go to points2shop. You can earn points so easily on points2shop by completing offers, surveys, playing games, or simply by clicking on links! It’s that easy! I just received an ipod nano from points2shop in the mail last month. You get all your prizes directly off amazon.com, which makes shopping for prizes a lot easier because amazon has every item you could possibly want.
