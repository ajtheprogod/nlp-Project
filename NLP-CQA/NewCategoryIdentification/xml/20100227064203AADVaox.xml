  <Question id="20100227064203AADVaox" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Internet Explorer 404 Error Pop Up. Even Opens when I dont have IE Open?</Subject>
    <Content>I have tried everything. Ive scanned my whole system and there are no errors. I have ended the IE process and it gets rid of my desktop toolbar.

I do use FireFox. But it still pops up. I think it is when I downloaded something because my Temp Internet Files keep gettin filled with all these porn/nudity pics/links I havnt even been too. But I have scanned and it comes up with nothing.

And Ideas?
