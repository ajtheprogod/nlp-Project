    <ChosenAnswer>In the top of the page, between PLAY and REDEEM, you have the invite section(CONNECT), just put the e-mail address of the people you want to invite and after you are done, click INVITE, they will receive an e-mail from Lockerz, and then, they&#039;ll only need to accept and register.
But I heard that they are having problems with hotmail address, not sure if they fixed that yet.</ChosenAnswer>
