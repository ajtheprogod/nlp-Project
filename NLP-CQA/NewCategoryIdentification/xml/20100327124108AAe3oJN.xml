    <Subject>Auto response from MAILER-DAEMON?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi, I have a question regarding mailer-daemon:

I have sent an email from sender@example.com to recipient@example.org.

(note that these are 2 different email servers; one is .com and the other .org)

As soon as I have sent the email to recipient@example.org I get an auto response from 
&quot;Mail Delivery System&quot; &lt;MAILER-DAEMON@example.org&gt; telling me that the email has been received and that they will get back to me as soon as possible(this seems to be a perfectly legitimate auto response that the recipient has created).

Now the email contents looks very normal with no indications of a bounce, undeliverable or anything but this &quot;MAILER-DAEMON&quot; stuff makes me wonder if there was actually something wrong with the delivery. Why is it that I did not get the auto response from recipient@example.org (where I sent it to) and got it from MAILER-DAEMON@example.org instead?

Any help?

Thanks a lot!

    <ChosenAnswer>Hello!

I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. It sounds like you are all set and they received the e-mail successfully. It may just be because the format of the auto response is different from the e-mail server.</ChosenAnswer>
