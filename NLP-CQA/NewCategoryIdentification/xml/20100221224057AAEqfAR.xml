  <Question id="20100221224057AAEqfAR" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I&#039;d like to get more activity on my site, any ideas on how to do this?</Subject>
    <Content>http://n-raged.com/forums/

I don&#039;t have much money to spend for advertising, although I am trying to use a few vouchers for advertising.  So where can I spam my site at to give it a boost of activity?  I&#039;ve managed to get some friends to sign up but that hasn&#039;t done much good.

Reasonable ideas are welcome (insulting or trolling responses will get reported).
