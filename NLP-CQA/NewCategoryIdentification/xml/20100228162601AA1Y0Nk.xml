    <ChosenAnswer>A few facts:

1. Carbon Copy Pro is a marketing system for newbies to learn internet marketing to market any product professionally on the web. It is an easily duplicatable process and therefore called carbon copy. It is NOT a software but an education system.

2. MLM Lead System Pro is similar now it its expanded version though earlier it was only for building MLM based businesses. The trainings in both are excellent

3. Neither is a scam

            <Content>I&#039;ve heard of Carbon Copy Cloner.  It&#039;s a HD back-up utility, and sells for $10.  I&#039;ve used it, and it&#039;s good software.
CarbonCopyPro appears to be some kind of scam.</Content>
