    <Subject>What&#039;s wrong with my Mozilla Firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve just been logging in to check my emails (Hotmail and Yahoo) and on both occasions Firefox is telling me these are untrusted sites. I also went on a well known football team&#039;s site to buy tickets and again when logging in I was told the site cannot be trusted. I have been on these sites many times before - why is it coming up as the sites being untrusted? I&#039;ve run my anti-virus/spyware software and no threats have been found.

    <ChosenAnswer>Check your security setting within Firefox and you can add both sites to your trusted list. I am not sure what version of Firefox you&#039;re running but I&#039;ve heard from a few people now about some bugs in the latest version 3.6.2. You also might have plugins installed that either need to be updated or removed for compatibility issues.</ChosenAnswer>
