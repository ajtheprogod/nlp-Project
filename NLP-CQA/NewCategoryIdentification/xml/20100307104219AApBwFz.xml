  <Question id="20100307104219AApBwFz" type="Answered">
    <Subject>can you reply to person repling your add through craigslist?</Subject>
    <Content>The reason I ask I have posted adds and people ask dumb questions about your add that aren&#039;t really important to your add. And then you never here from them again which I know ends up being a scam cause the next thing you know your getting emails with nothing but spam crap. The reason is I am not to bright and I reply using my email. Can you reply to someone&#039;s add through craislist without using your own email? Please don&#039;t laugh at my question.
