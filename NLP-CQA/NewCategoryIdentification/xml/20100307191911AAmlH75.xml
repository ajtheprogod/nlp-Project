            <Content>I was going to suggest F/fox but you&#039;re using it.  Have you &#039;defragged&#039; yr hard drive lately?

Do a clean up of all unnecessary temp files, downloaded files &amp; history.   5Gb Ram is heaps I&#039;m only using 1 GB Ram with my old XP D/T &amp; 2 Gb Ram with Win 7 &amp; not having any probs.  Are you sure Mcafee isn&#039;t taking up too many resources?

Change some of yr start up programs too (not everything needs to boot on start up).  If you&#039;ve tried all of that then perhaps check with yr ISP.  Sometimes mine (wireless dongle) runs a little slow (due to weather conditions in Aust.)  

Have you tried ccleaner, or malwarebytes or spybot search &amp; destroy (all free fr filehippo.com) - might be worth downloading just to check once &amp; if you don&#039;t find anything remove. 

 I use a full internet security suite not just anti-virus, hope I&#039;ve given you a couple of ideas.    Good luck</Content>
            <Reference>Have used several different AV&#039;s  over the yrs &amp; some a real &#039;resource&#039; hogs.</Reference>
