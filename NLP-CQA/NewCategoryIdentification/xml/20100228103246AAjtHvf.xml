    <Subject>Why do so many web pages get taken over by bitching women?</Subject>
    <Content>I have been a member of a few web site forums and every one seems to be taken over by a group of bitching women who act like school bullies and need other idiots to join in with them to be part of the gang as they&#039;re too stupid or scared to speak for themselves. The first one was a message board about hair and make-up and the latest one is a fan page on facebook for Craig Busch the lion man. It isn&#039;t just me. I see other people being bullied and when I speak out against it, I just get attacked by the gang members to become bullied myself. Why are groups of supposedly adult women like that?

    <ChosenAnswer>The internet is (mostly) annoymous.  People think they can hide behind their computers and do/type whatever they want and to the most part, that is correct.  This allows them the freedom to do things that normally wouldnt get away with in &quot;real life&quot;.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It&#039;s really no different to what goes on here in some categories and the Suggestion Board.

They&#039;re all like little packs of trolls or ankles biters going nit, nit, nit, nit, nit all over the place!

Come bedtime they all retreat under their respective bridges.</Content>
