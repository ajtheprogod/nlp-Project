    <Content>8 days ago, a buyer, with a fake name and address, unfortunately won my item on eBay for £26.00. he still hasn&#039;t paid, despite the fact i opened an unpaid items case against him 4 days ago,  I was wondering, if i close the case, do i receive a payment for the £26.00 from eBay?

    <ChosenAnswer>unfortunately ebay sellers have little or no rights ( i am an ebay seller and i get unpaid items about 5 times each month).  all ebay will do is credit your fees, you will have to relist the item or give a second chance offer to the second highest bidder.
the non paying winner will recieve a strike on their account.....but this basically makes little difference......I HATE EBAY.
hope this helps</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>No. Why would or should eBay pay? 

If the guy doesn&#039;t pay, you don&#039;t ship. Simple as.



I think you get your listing fee back, or you get to relist for free, something like that.</Content>

            <Content>To be honest i don&#039;t think so as you should wait for payment to be received until sending the item whatever it is, also unless you&#039;re protected with pay pal i don&#039;t see you getting the money back unless you keep the case open, if you close it at your end it will deem that you are satisfied also.</Content>
