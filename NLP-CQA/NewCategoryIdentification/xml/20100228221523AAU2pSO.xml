    <Subject>Problems with latest Firefox eating memory or Yahoo Answers?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay I have been out here the last couple of days on the net and I have noticed that my computer is bogging down especially on my input devices. So today I pulled up Task Manager and Firefox is eating memory BIG time. When I first signed on it was about 500MB total usage but after awhile I was up to 1.5 gigs total usage and most was being used by Firefox. Now I only have two windows open so is it Firefox or Yahoo answers that is swallow my memory wholesale?

    <ChosenAnswer>Depends on how much ram you have installed. FireFox has been using 1,000K. Even though I have 4GB ram. You might try and run a registry cleaner? Or up your ram?</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Looks like you might have fasterfox enabled.
Disabling it will ensure that you&#039;re not trying to download pages ahead of time.
Piping your connection can slow it down for most machines that don&#039;t have a
lot of RAM to work with. If you don&#039;t have FasterFox installed then install it.
Set it to Turbo and it won&#039;t use as much memory with the &quot;Turbo&quot; setting.


Hope that helps. o_O

Install Apple Safari,it rules!! It&#039;s much faster than Firefox.
P.S don&#039;t use Chrome,its all hype and it lacks security!!
