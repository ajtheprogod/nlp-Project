    <ChosenAnswer>I have evaluated chrome, the only thing chrome is good for is flashing routers.  it&#039;s perfect for that, but don&#039;t use it as a browser - it doesn&#039;t load 75% of sites I visit, and they are reputable.

apple safari is good and supports html 5.0 with more capabilities than other browsers
mozilla firefox is good but features break if you use plugins. doesn&#039;t always print well.
IE is insecure but a good browser, prints well.
Opera is fast, but doesn&#039;t use webkit like safari and firefox, and renders DHTML in a way that requires special handling (at least my display:block code didn&#039;t work).  actually, code that works on everything else doesn&#039;t work on opera.  headache for the DHTML coder.

I would say stick with firefox or safari to be safe.</ChosenAnswer>
