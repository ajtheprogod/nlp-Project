    <ChosenAnswer>Freeservers like Webs can only offer subdomains because they are no costs attached to them. Domain names do have fees associated with them so they can&#039;t be given away in mass quantities.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Unfortunately you cannot get a completely free domain name and website.

I personally got my domain name through http://www.hostingcouponoffer.com they register your www.blahblah.com free for life (in your name).

come with a fantastic website wizard, 24hr support and at $4.84 it&#039;s as near to free as you&#039;ll get.

Hope it helps, Lee</Content>
