    <Subject>How do I delete all my recent book marks in firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>I never use the recent bookmarks thing, I always bookmark websites by accident. I thought it was okay because only about 10 show up when I view the recent bookmarks. After importing my bookmarks from firefox to chrome chrome had every freaking single bookmark I&#039;ve accidentally clicked over 2 years.. There were 100s! Well almost..

I know they&#039;re hiding somewhere and I can&#039;t delete them the way I&#039;d delete normal bookmarks.. What do I do? Is there a bookmarks folder somewhere that I can delete?
