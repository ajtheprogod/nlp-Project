    <ChosenAnswer>It could mean one of three things:

1) The author is not a native English speaker and has made a small grammatical mistake. The author probably would have really meant something like, `to have Internet access`. 

2) The author is not familiar with the concept of the Internet.

3) The author is a /b/tard and is using the expression in a new context. For example, if you were to provide me with warez and I wanted to express my gratitude, I might say, `Over 9000 Internets to you, good sir`, regardless of your biological sex or established gender role.</ChosenAnswer>
