  <Question id="20100224173149AA4yDIe" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Facepunch forum ban correct?</Subject>
    <Content>Banned by the Super Moderator because I said &quot;I pirated GMod 10 once to try before I buy, I bought a copy later because of it.&quot; 

I get a 2 day ban and he says we don&#039;t tolerate that crap and buying it later doesn&#039;t count.

Well if he expects me to pay for a really chopped up limited copy of the game then he can go suck one.

Isn&#039;t this a little abuse? Currently trying to find a higher up and inform him of this.
Yeah y&#039;all are right. I mean it was kind of rude but he has to let others know pirating will not be tolerated and that I should be lucky he didn&#039;t let the team know and fine me the $250,000.00 piracy fine. Guess I got off easy. Better apologize when the ban is worn off.

    <ChosenAnswer>The issue is you technically broke the law and you made it public knowledge, as much as I think he was just being a dick I think he was just making an example of you to let the message be known</ChosenAnswer>
