    <ChosenAnswer>Yes, if they wanted to, they could track down cheaters.  However, I do not think that they would ban someone if a few of the invites have the same IP because they clearly state that EVERY eligible person in a household is allowed to have an account.  And people in the same household would indeed have the same IP.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Well since you only want a yes/no answer I&#039;m going to say yes because I know that will stop you cheating.

I don&#039;t actually care about you or lockerz or you cheating on lockerz, but you should know that cheating is wrong.</Content>

            <Content>ah, you idiot. now that youve left your email available if i click your picture, i can report you to lockerz and have your account suspended. i will recieve all of your points, and you will never be able to get on lockerz without changing your ip address, which is more expensive than buying a new computer. 

thanks, you dumb b.i.t.c.h</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>Well, if you use bots, then you have a 50/50 chance. What I mean, is if you used bots to get a prize, there going to send you an email and tell you that you cannot redeem that prize because you have not earned PTZ legitimately.

And, if you make a couple of accounts, refer them and make them join, lockerz checks how fast you referred them, there activity, and there PTZ stats.

So, my answer would be yes, lockerz will track down cheaters, but not send you to jail or sue you.</Content>
            <Reference>I recommend using swagbucks, its a search and win site, but you earn 8 times the points of lockerz! Here is my referral link if you would like to use it.
