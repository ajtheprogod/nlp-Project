  <Question id="20100308215834AA4qUBc" type="Answered">
    <Subject>where to report inappropriate websites?</Subject>
    <Content>I heard of this website where people take videos of animals heads being chopped off and things of that nature and upload the videos to their website, and I feel like that is very disgusting and wrong. I am wondering if there is a way for me to report the website, but I don&#039;t know who exactly I would tell.

    <ChosenAnswer>If the website does illegal stuff,
you can check out this website, it explains a little bit:

I also heard that police departments usually have a non emergency number you can call to report it.</ChosenAnswer>
