    <Subject>How to count rows in a table that is online?</Subject>
    <Content>I am working at doing some data input for a fitness company. My job is to count how many clients the company has each day and put this in an excel spreadsheet.

The company&#039;s records for the last year are on the internet in the form of tables whereby each row counts as one customer. So, a 26 row column = 26 customers.

It&#039;s very laborious to have to count the rows though and I was wondering if anyone knows if it&#039;s possible to somehow highlight all the tables and count them that way? Or any other way?

Would be much appreciated
Is there any way of counting the rows online or do I have to copy into excel?

    <ChosenAnswer>use the counta() function
if your data is in column A
then copy&amp;paste this formula

=COUNTA(A1:A99999)

then as you add rows, the formula will automatically adjust.
if you have a header row, then you probably dont want to count the column label so adjust it to
=COUNTA(A2:A99999)
i just used A99999 because its large enough to count a bunch as you add.  if you have more customers, then just adjust the 99999 part

edit-
sorry, i dont know how to count online
i would copy&amp;paste into excel</ChosenAnswer>
