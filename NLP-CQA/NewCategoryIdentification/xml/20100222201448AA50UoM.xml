    <ChosenAnswer>You have to buy your own domain name no matter what. You can actually have google host it and it works just like GMail. For free, even.

            <Content>You have a few options, but non are free.

1) There are registrars (companies that you buy domains from) that will let you buy a domain and e-mail hosting for next to nothing. 

2) Buy a domain with e-mail forwarding, and have all e-mails forward to an existing e-mail account. This means when you reply, your testemail@mtz.com won&#039;t show as the from e-mail address.

3) Buy a domain and use free web hosting. There are a few good ones around.

4) Get a subdomain e-mail address, like youname@anothername.zzn.com. I&#039;m sure there are a few like this around. Try http://www.zzn.com</Content>
