  <Question id="20100317132356AANVUMm" type="Answered">
    <Subject>If I ask a seller a question on Ebay am I obligated to buy?</Subject>
    <Content>I asked a seller a question about their item 24 hours ago and they have not responded. Me buying their item was dependent on me getting the right answer back from them. However, I am kind of in a hurry to order and have another seller I could buy from right now who has already answered my question.

Is it rude to buy from that other person or should I wait another 24 hours to see if the original seller has responded? I have not pressed buy now on anything, and have not made any bids.

    <ChosenAnswer>I tend to give 24 hours for a response.  I&#039;ve sold plenty of items on Ebay, and if someone sends me a question but I forget to log-in and check, I consider it my fault.  I&#039;ve had customers find someone else to buy from, and it&#039;s not a big deal.  Things happen.  You&#039;re not obligated to buy unless you actually put a bid in.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You are not obligated to purchase they are just deciding to not respond to you. Maybe another message will remind them to respond.</Content>

            <Content>You are not obliged to buy until you have clicked the buy now button and confirmed the purchase.
If a buyer can&#039;t be bothered to answer you question then that, in my book, would be a good reason to buy from someone else.</Content>

            <Content>They will eventually get your question, be patient. He probably hasn&#039;t checked his email in awhile.But, he might not until the bid is already over. Then you have to bid somewhere else. You are not obligated to buy anything until you place a bid. Buy from the other guy, it doesn&#039;t matter. Nobody&#039;s taking names.</Content>

            <Content>No it is NOT rude.
The one who answered is paying more attention to their account than the one who didn&#039;t.

There is NO requirement to bid or buy, just because you asked a question.
I ask questions all the time to help me decide whether I want to bid or not.</Content>
