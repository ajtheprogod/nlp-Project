    <Subject>Websites where sex stories, or &quot;lemons&quot; are ok?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a Quizilla.com account (TonksMoony2) and I started writing lemon stories and they got deleted because they changed the rules. Do any of you know of any websites where &quot;lemon&quot; stories are ok?

Chapter 38 of Our Fake Relationship was deleted on quizilla and was allowed on that website. So I guess it is okay for that kind of story. I&#039;m not sure thought.
