    <Subject>Bnftuhtr, the bbshoe website man?</Subject>
    <Content>Bnftuhtr often answers questions telling people to visit bbshoe.com

I don&#039;t want to go there as I don&#039;t want to get a mad virus or malware, but am now hugely intrigued, it&#039;s become a kind of forbidden fruit to me. Will someone please go there &amp; report back, i doubt you&#039;d get a virus but who can tell... Thanks.

    <ChosenAnswer>I just went to that site, it&#039;s a parked page. It&#039;s not a real website, just ads. The owner makes money when people click on the ads. Looks like it&#039;s parked with Google Parking for Domains. If that&#039;s the guy&#039;s website and he&#039;s spamming on here, he&#039;s stupid because eventually they will catch him and won&#039;t pay him and make take legal action because spamming is against their terms of service. I make money from parking domains, but I don&#039;t spam to get traffic there. You aren&#039;t allowed to advertise parked domains.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I went there and I don&#039;t think I got a virus... but it was kind of weird. I don&#039;t think that this site will be very helpful. It has links to like handbags and stuff. If this is what you are looking for then it is probably safe, but I don&#039;t know.</Content>
