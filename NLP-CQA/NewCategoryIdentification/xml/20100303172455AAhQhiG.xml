    <ChosenAnswer>you all need to read her requirements!  with the requirement: block websites

IE can block web sites.
not safari, not opera, not chrome, not firefox.
only IE can do that.
If that were not your requirement, safari and firefox would be my best recommendations as far as ability to render documents.

however, firefox doesn&#039;t always print well.  there is an overflow:hidden thing which people are using to display text on IE for printing (why?) and it&#039;s causing cross-browser problems.  it&#039;s their own fault.</ChosenAnswer>
