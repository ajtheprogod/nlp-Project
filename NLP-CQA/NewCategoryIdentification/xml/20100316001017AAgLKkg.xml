    <ChosenAnswer>http=Hypertext Transfer Protocol -  is definition of protocol your browser has to use for specyfic site ( it&#039;s kinda obvious that you use web browser to browse web pages, but they can contain links to skype or MSN username - different protocol in links tells browser to open different applications to handle that adress - in this example skype and msn )
www= World Wide Web - it&#039;s remainder of old times when computers had low specs and you had to use different machine for different tasks - for example one server to web pages ( www.domain.com), one for e-mail communication (mail.domain.com) and one for transferring files (ftp.domain.com). Currently even one server is more than capable to handle all that tasks, so you don&#039;t have to type which specific service you want to connect to ( www, mail or ftp...) - still, many webmasters use them in adresses, out of custom.</ChosenAnswer>
