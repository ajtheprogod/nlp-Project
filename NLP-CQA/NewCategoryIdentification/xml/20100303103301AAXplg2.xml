    <ChosenAnswer>Get a pigsback credit card.  You get one point for every two euro spent and if you clear your balance monthly it will cost you nothing apart from annual government tax.  So if you spend 500 Euro in a month you will get 250 piggy points.  You will quickly have the government tax paid for in rewards if you use it every day.</ChosenAnswer>
