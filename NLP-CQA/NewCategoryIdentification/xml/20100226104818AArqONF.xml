  <Question id="20100226104818AArqONF" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Has anybody used dataentryspot.com?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m interested in using them and don&#039;t want to get burned.
Maybe I should clarify I&#039;m thinking about signing up to work for them.  I was wondering if you can really make money.  Anyone doing the work, is it real work or just trying to sell stuff?  Let me know please.

I have a variety of comments that I would like to make after seeing that.
One thing I can say is they also hire anyone in the world so you never know who you are going to get to work on your project.  Let alone if they even know your language which affects accuracy.  I know a person with terrible accuracy and I know that she could get a job with them.</ChosenAnswer>
