  <Question id="20100317123224AAtQ327" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Ebay: i won an auction but then saw the same top really cheap?</Subject>
    <Content>the top ive already won is £21 and like £3 P+P
and then yesterday i saw the exact same top ending tomorrow and there is currently no bidders (starting price £6)
and the second one will fit me better

do you think i should contact the first seller and let them know i dont want to buy it or just leave it? im worried that i&#039;ll get a bad reputation :/
i tried looking for the same top but the person put the description nothing like what it is

    <ChosenAnswer>Contact the seller and agree to pay the listing fee. It usually only a few dollars. Most sellers will just let it go as long as you talk w them but the offer is nice. Agree to leave good ratings on both sides and they can then relist. Letting it go completely might get you a bad rating.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Contact the seller and if the matter can be resolved peacefully, but keep in mind, when you bidded on the auction you became obligated to pay for it.

If the seller declines to let you off the hook, you have to pay for it, or get negative feedback and possible other consequences.</Content>

            <Content>You should never bid on an auction then change your mind.  It&#039;s not fair to the seller and you&#039;ll develop a bad reputation on ebay for doing this.

Stay true to your word/bid and follow through with what you started.  Be more investigative next time.</Content>

            <Content>With eBay you can try to negotiate with the seller they might agree  Most will not do that. You are obliged to buy what you bid on.</Content>
