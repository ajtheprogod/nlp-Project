  <Question id="20100315053528AAP2HEL" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What happened to diaryland.com?</Subject>
    <Content>O_O I had diary entries there going back to 2003. It was like a history of my entire life since I was 13.

Now when I go there it&#039;s giving me one of those silly fake directories you see when the domain name hasn&#039;t been bought yet.

Does anyone know what happened? Did they announce they were going down? I feel like I just lost a flipping library of writings and I&#039;m really upset.
Rally: Hmm, I can&#039;t get into mine with this method, but your post was reassuring. I&#039;m still nervous, but I hope you&#039;re right, we&#039;ll see what happens over the next day or two...

    <ChosenAnswer>I panicked all day about it, but it&#039;s OK! Supposedly there was a lapse renewing the domain name or something and it&#039;s going to take a little bit to get everything working again (I don&#039;t know if this is true or not). 

More importantly, how to get your diary (or anyway how I got mine back):

Empty your browser&#039;s cache.
Restart your computer.
It should now work. My diary was locked and I had to unlock it to access it. I assume if there was a lapse and renewal of the domain name that things got shifted around. 

OK, back to backing it all up.
