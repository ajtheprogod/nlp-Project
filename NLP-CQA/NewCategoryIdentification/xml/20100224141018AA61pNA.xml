  <Question id="20100224141018AA61pNA" type="Answered">
    <Subject>If I click on a bit.ly link, am I being tracked?</Subject>
    <Content>A few of my friends have been posting &quot;bit.ly&quot; links on Facebook. Will my friends know when I&#039;ve clicked on the link? I know that bit.ly tracks the number of clicks, but will my friends know WHO is clicking the links?
I understand that bit.ly or some other 3rd party could be tracking me... that&#039;s a whole different issue. I also understand the danger of internet hackers--though I seriously doubt any of my friends are one. My question is in reference to bit.ly itself-- is this site designed to help people track who is clicking their links?????
