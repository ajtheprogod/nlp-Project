    <Subject>Internet Connection Wireless?</Subject>
    <Content>Is there anyway to find out who has been using my username and password to connect to internet?
Example...My friend knows my username and password,has wireless equipment the same as mine and goes home types in my UN AND PASS and connects.Is there any way that I find out is someone doing this?
I know changing the password can do the trick,but I wanted to find out who is the doing this.Eventually I will change my password.

            <Content>Well you try and keep track of your internet usage ( you can probably get that from your internet supplier&#039;s site) if more than what you are downloading has been downloaded then yes someone is using it.
I don&#039;t really know how to find out who exactly ( i don&#039; t think you can)
In any case i suggest that you change your password</Content>

            <Content>There is most certainly a way to know if someone is in fact accessing your internet, I have had the same problem with the folks next door, but by having certain ports open you could allow just you &amp; your friend to access that wireless router, or if you have a good alert system like Sygate Personal Firewall, you could find out who was using your internet service.</Content>
