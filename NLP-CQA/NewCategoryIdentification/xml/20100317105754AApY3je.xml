  <Question id="20100317105754AApY3je" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Adobe Flash Player on Windows 7?</Subject>
    <Content>My computer&#039;s system type is 64-bit. But I know that only 32-bit ones work with Adobe Flash Player. So what can I do?
I see that I would need to run the 32-bit browser. But is there any detailed step in how to run the 32-bit browser in the 64-bit operating system? 
GREATLY appreciate your help!

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi YCV,

According to Adobe Flash Player site - &quot;Adobe Flash Player is not supported for playback in a 64-bit browser. However, you can run Flash Player in a 32-bit browser running on a 64-bit operating system.&quot; For additional information, visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/000/6b3af6c9.html.
