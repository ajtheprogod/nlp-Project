  <Question id="20100224162843AAAYOVt" type="Answered">
    <Subject>whats the name of this search engine?</Subject>
    <Content>i forgot what it&#039;s called, but its a combination of other search engines like google, yahoo, msn (and some more), and also video sites, like youtube and blinkx. it had a dark gray/black background and on the main page there were four or more rows for each topic (like image search and video search) in a fimstrip style that could be scrolled to the left or right.
and i think it has a &quot;z&quot; in it, and might be like a real word except for the fact that it&#039;s spelt with a z
