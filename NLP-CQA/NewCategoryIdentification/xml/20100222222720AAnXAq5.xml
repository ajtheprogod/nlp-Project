  <Question id="20100222222720AAnXAq5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I can&#039;t visit entered URLs in Firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>Here is the problem.  I suddenly can&#039;t go to a web site I&#039;ve typed in myself.  I can type it in but when I hit enter nothing happens.  When I click the &quot;go&quot; arrow next to the URL box nothing happens.  I can visit my bookmarks without issues, I can click links on web sites without problems, I can click my &quot;stumble&quot; button without problems.  I just can&#039;t go to a URL that is in the URL box.

And for those of you skimming this question and thinking of asking if my enter key is working I assure you that it is and that I am currently using it to type this question.

The only change I&#039;ve made is that I&#039;ve installed Miro (a video player that was recommended by Firefox) and I have since uninstalled it and done a system restore with no change.  Any suggestions?
The thing is I can visit all the sites through IE.  It&#039;s not sitting there and idling.  It&#039;s just not doing ANYTHING.  No status bar, no time outs.  It&#039;s just ignoring the enter key and go arrow.
I do run AVG...I wonder if this caused the issue...I tried disabling all extensions (starting in safe mode) and it didn&#039;t help so I made a new profile and dragged over all my extensions and bookmarks and all is good with the new extension.  If it happens again maybe I&#039;ll remove the AVG tool bar.  Thanks for the information

    <ChosenAnswer>AVG can cause this issue. You can also try disabling extensions one at a time and restarting FF to see if an extension is causing the problem.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I&#039;m having trouble getting to certain web sites and domains myself, right now. I don&#039;t know if this is a problem with the DNS server I use, or if there are web sites being attacked right now. Best thing is to wait a little bit and see what things look like in an hour, maybe 30 minutes.</Content>
