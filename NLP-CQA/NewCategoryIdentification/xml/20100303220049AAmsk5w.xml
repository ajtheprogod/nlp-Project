    <ChosenAnswer>I assume that you want these photos to be viewable in the GE layers?
The easiest way to add photos to the layers is to open a free
panoramio account and upload them there. You will need to position
them on the globe after you upload them. If they qualify, they will
eventually be added to the panoramio layer in the geographic web. You
will also get a network link for your images which you can use
immediately to see them in GE.

Read the FAQ on the panoramio site to get an idea of the type of
photos which get added to GE and which ones don&#039;t.</ChosenAnswer>
