    <ChosenAnswer>You can only redeem prizes on lockerz during one of their restocks usually near the end of the month. They&#039;ll say when they restock. When they restock the prizes go FAST so you have to be ready to redeem what you want fast. when it says more soon it just means they have none in stock.
