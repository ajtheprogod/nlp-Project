    <ChosenAnswer>I can suggest Swagbucks. Its a free prize winning site. Very legit. Ive made over $100 in amazon.com gift cards and $25 in paypal. Swagbucks is just like a google search engine but you randomly win swagbucks for searching. There&#039;s many other ways to win too and many other prizes!! Try it out-     http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</ChosenAnswer>
