  <Question id="20100306104921AAdlCWh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>If I get an account on Formspringme, will I still be able to ask people questions anonymously?</Subject>
    <Content>Some people on that website have their question posted on someone else&#039;s site, with their username next to it. Will that happen to me if I make an account? Because for now, without making an account no one knows it is me asking the question.
