  <Question id="20100327200732AAKzo94" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is this illegal downloading?</Subject>
    <Content>Recently I came across a downloader, DVD Video Soft Free Studio, or something like that, that can download YouTube videos to your computer and convert them into mp3 files which can be uploaded onto iTunes. Is this legal or illegal? Thank you!

    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s technically illegal, but this is the digital equivalent of jaywalking. There is absolutely no chance of you ever getting in any kind of trouble for it; people illegally download millions of songs a day, and there have only ever been a handful of legal cases (these always involve people who download the music and then sell copies of it to others, and the cases are more of a scare tactic to try and discourage others than an actual fight against piracy).</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It&#039;s illegal. Not everything that can be done is legal. Whenever you are using someone else&#039;s work without paying for it , it is illegal - otherwise the site will say &quot;free use&quot;.</Content>
