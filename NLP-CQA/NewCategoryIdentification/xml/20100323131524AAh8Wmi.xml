    <ChosenAnswer>im confused...
delete a question on playlist.com?
not a clue! 
don&#039;t worry about a question on playlist, it will probably be ignored anyways

to delete a question on answer.yahoo.com go hover your mouse over the &quot;save&quot; button right under the question you posted and a list of things will appear, one says &quot;delete question&quot;, click on it
note: this only works for questions you deleted</ChosenAnswer>
