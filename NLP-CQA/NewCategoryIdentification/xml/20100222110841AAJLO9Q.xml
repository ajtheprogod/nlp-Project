  <Question id="20100222110841AAJLO9Q" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Anyone on Karaoke Channel Online?  Question:  Why is voice always off from music?</Subject>
    <Content>I know how to use the + and - under song edit, but I still can&#039;t seem to get the timing right.  I can&#039;t even make any of my songs public yet, because of this problem!  Why should I have to adjust it anyway?  Every single song I sing is way off and seems to get only worse throughout the song, but I sing just as the lines for the lyrics prompt me to!  I&#039;m getting irratated!  Anyone else have this problem?  How can I fix it?  Thanks!
