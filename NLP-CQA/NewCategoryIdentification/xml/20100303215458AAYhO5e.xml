    <Subject>How do I acces the password, to connect to my Internet network?</Subject>
    <Content>I forgot the password to connect to my network, I haven&#039;t the slightest idea of what to do.
Im trying to wirelessly connect to my home network with a portable device, Its a secured network so I need a password, I lost the password, and was wondering is there any way of retriving it, like is it stored in a file on my computer or what?
There is none of which you just stated on my computer, Im not sure if we have different windows programs or what, but I didnt see a single bit of any of that.
