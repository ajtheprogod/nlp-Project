    <ChosenAnswer>If you mean a shoutout, then all you have to do is tweet either &#039;shoutout to [username]&#039; or &#039;go follow [username]&#039; or something along these lines. You can also say positive things about them. Some poeple will tweet &#039;shoutout4shoutout&#039; where if you give them a shoutout, they will give you one back. If someone randomly gives you a shoutout, then you don&#039;t have to give them one back if you don&#039;t want to but it&#039;s always nice to say thankyou to them, that way they may give you more in the future! 
Fridays are known as &#039;Follow Fridays&#039;. This is where you give shoutouts to lots of people on friday. eg. &#039;FF! @[username] @[username2] @[username3] etc..&#039; (FF = Follow Friday).

Hope this helps :)</ChosenAnswer>
