    <ChosenAnswer>I have done quite a bit of research on this and the only way to search for a cell phone number for free is by searching it on Google. For example type in:
“555-555-5555”

Cell phone numbers unlike landline numbers are kept private so they are not available publicly through the phone book or yellow pages. It is actually illegal for the phone companies to make cell phone data public domain.

Unfortunately searching for it through Google often very rarely tells you anything about the person.

There is however a way to identify the cell number’s identity, address, and a lot more.  You do need to pay a small fee to get this information because it is private and services pay a lot of money to gain access to the cell phone directory.

But you can search and preview the results for free. If you are not satisfied afterward they offer a full 60 day guarantee to get a refund.

            <Content>that number is included in a long list of numbers that call you and just hang up.
I had a problem similar to this one and did soooooooooooooo much research on the number that kept calling and it turned up that the person who live in my address before me owed some money and a Financial agency was trying to collect so they used a bogus number to see if anybody was home and later called with another number trying to speak to the person who lived there previously. 
 ( reason they called with bogus number is that the person didn&#039;t answer the phone when Caller ID said Private or the Financial company name)
I finally talked to the financial company many many times  convinced them that person didn&#039;t live there anymore and they stopped calling, they explained they go by address to look for someone because people tend to change phone numbers easier than address.

hope this helps</Content>
