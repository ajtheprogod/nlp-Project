    <ChosenAnswer>The listings seem fine, try putting a few as &quot;buy it now&quot; rather than auction style format.  People often just want to buy one quickly rather than bidding and wondering if they will win, especially if it is going to be a gift.  Try changing a few to BIN and see if that makes a difference?

Also your feedback rating might be what is making people hesitant. Its a shame I know as this is nothing to do with your work I looked to what the negative comment was. 

I&#039;ve had the odd negative over the years and it ruins your 100% record but it will be gone after 12 months and you will get your 100% back. Many buyers don&#039;t even look at sellers with less than 99% feedback I&#039;m afraid.</ChosenAnswer>
