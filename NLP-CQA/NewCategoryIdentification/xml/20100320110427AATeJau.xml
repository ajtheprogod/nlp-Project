  <Question id="20100320110427AATeJau" type="Answered">
    <Subject>My computer keeps opening new windows to my homepage?</Subject>
    <Content>What the hell is wrong with my computer? It just keeps opening new pages (to my homepage) and won&#039;t stop!
It doesn&#039;t open a window to any porn site or a bullsh*t &quot;reward&quot; site, it just keeps opening to my home page. I have like 30 windows to my home page.

It&#039;s more annoying than dangerous, but I still want it to stop
