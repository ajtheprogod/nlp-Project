            <Content>i think something is going on with services, because the same thing is happening to me. i tried on the computer and thought maybe the keyboard was messing up again, so i tried on my phone and instead of the invalid info, it said services currently down. 

we just need to be patient and wait for AIM to go back up.</Content>
