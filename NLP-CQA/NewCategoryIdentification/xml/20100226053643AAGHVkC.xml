  <Question id="20100226053643AAGHVkC" type="Answered">
    <Subject>idea for my website, i need your opinion please?</Subject>
    <Content>I am making a social networking/chatscript and i had a small idea about how to get people to join and would like your opinion on this

I was thinking about giving every member a trial membership for lets say 30 days
in those 30 days you will have to invite atleast 5 people and 1 of them has to join atleast

otherwise your account will be suspended..

do you think this wil work?
its not really a trick to make ppl to join but more a way of advertising
to phil, you dont pay for it, you just contribute by advertising

            <Content>Okay men. I think this will not work. It&#039;s not a good plan, brother. 1st of all, even you or me doesn&#039;t  want a kind of social network. Just invite others to join the social network. Just let them decide and it&#039;s there own if they want or not. Or if you really want try to advertise with some advertising website. Hope it helps.</Content>
