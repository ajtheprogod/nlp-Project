  <Question id="20100318070649AAKIPhC" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can a radio station legally download from P2P networks?</Subject>
    <Content>If a radio station pays for its PPL and PRS, is it legal for the station to obtain music from a p2p network such as bittorrent?  Surely since the radio station pays the artist via its PRS licence, it is already paying for the licence to play the content.  I ask because currently we have to buy our music twice - first at the shop, then we pay the PRS.
Radio stations don&#039;t need to clear copyright for each and every tune.  They pay a licence to play any tune, and the money goes straight to the artist.
Yes, we are a bona fide community radio station.  We don&#039;t get sent music directly - we have to buy it in.

Is it illegal to download mp3 files if we pay for them with our PRS licence?

    <ChosenAnswer>Provided you&#039;ve already paid it you can download it but P2P? Don&#039;t use that stuff! See the risks of file-sharing technology at http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST05-007.html
Instead, look at http://searchformusic.eu.pn/
It searches more than 80 free, safe, legal downloading-music sites (for whole albums, add the word &quot;rapidshare&quot;). This way you can forget about viruses.

            <Content>No, it is illegal for anyone to download from a P2P.
If you get music without buying it, it is considered illegal, because you are &quot;stealing from the artist&quot;.
Say each song is $0.99, if 100 people download the same song by the same artist
that&#039;s $99+ they have lost which in the end adds up.
But radio stations have to get permission from the artists and get copywrite</Content>

            <Content>If you are a genuine bona fide radio station, you should get your product direct from the record label that releases it.  Never heard of a radio station buying their music at a store before</Content>
