    <Content>Hey guys, here&#039;s the situation. This post says:

@AlterBridgeFans hey guys! i havent heard what you all will do for an AB blu ray/dvd. use #wwyd4AB the winners get picked tomorrow!

I understand everything apart from &quot;use #wwyd4AB&quot;

I don&#039;t really understand what is meant by &quot;use it&quot;. It is highlighted in the post and when I click it, it brings me to a page with everyone&#039;s responses, but when I type in the box to try and respond, and post, it just comes up with a status update and doesn&#039;t put my response in the list. Any help?

    <ChosenAnswer>Tell him the craziest thing that you would do for a bluray/dvd player. Try to use that code at the end of your tweet so he knows you are doing it for the contest. Give it a shot! :)</ChosenAnswer>
