    <ChosenAnswer>I find that www.amplezone.com is just like craigslist.org for classified ads that are free. Amplezone.com has a great simple interface, many users, and I suggest it to everyone to use it, best of all, it&#039;s free. I hope I helped!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>craigslist is likely your best bet, unless you want to look in the newspaper&#039;s advertisement section. craigslist is ideal due to the fact that it&#039;s local. ebay and amazon both are cheap and both have used products but for buying something such as a car or boat you would not want to use either.</Content>
