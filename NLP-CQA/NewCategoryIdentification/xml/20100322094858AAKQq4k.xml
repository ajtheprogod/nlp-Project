  <Question id="20100322094858AAKQq4k" type="Answered">
    <Subject>why doesn&#039;t my internet explorer work?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m trying to download an anti-virus software through internet explorer but my explorer is not working.  Because of that I can&#039;t scan my computer and it&#039;s now filled with viruses I can&#039;t get rid of.  Meanwhile I keep getting warnings that my computer is infected asking me to download the software I can&#039;t do. Is there anything I can do?  Any advice would be helpful.

    <ChosenAnswer>the warnings is a scam to get you to download and buy their software don&#039;t do it. do system restore if you cant do anything. turn off your computer and turn it back on holding down the R key until you hear clicking and the system restore comes on, do full system restore with no back up</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The viruses may have already infected it, but try a system restore to a point before you got the virus. At the very least, you should be able to download some effective software.</Content>
