            <Content>If you set up a card with your paypal, then when you purchase from ebay, it will debit/credit from the card. So no funds need to be in your paypal for this, just make sure you have the card you want as the primary, and it will use that one.</Content>

            <Content>There are two ways to set up your PayPal - one is directly from your bank, where yes, you would have to have money in your balance. The other way is to a credit card, which is basically just debt, so no, you wouldn&#039;t have to have money in the bank... but you would have to pay it off eventually.

PayPal just goes to places that you already pay with - it&#039;s not like a separate bank or anything. It&#039;s kind of just the middleman that makes shopping more convenient. :)</Content>

            <Content>You don&#039;t have to have an account with paypal at all to buy something on ebay. You can make one time payments after you buy something or select to have it automatically taken from you bank account.</Content>
