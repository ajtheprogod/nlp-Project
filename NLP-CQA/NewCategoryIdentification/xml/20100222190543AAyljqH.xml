  <Question id="20100222190543AAyljqH" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there somewhere on the internet that is like a &#039;reverse ebay&#039;?</Subject>
    <Content>I know that&#039;s a dumb way to ask it but I&#039;m really not sure how else to... ebay is people selling things looking for people to buy them, is there anywhere out there where people can ask for what they want and others browsing the site might decide to sell it to them? Craigslist doesn&#039;t work for me as I&#039;m looking for something that isn&#039;t sold in my country.
I hope that was clear enough... sorry if it wasn&#039;t. Thank you for checking this out.
