  <Question id="20100322214607AA3plOv" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I delete my browsing history on Firefox on a mac?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve looked at other answers to this question and honestly, they&#039;re too vague. Maybe I&#039;m just dumb, but I need step by step instructions, and a lot of explaining apparently. I&#039;m terrible with computers. Some people told me to go to tools: First of all I don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about, and I don&#039;t have it at the top on the bar. Other told me to just go to history and clear it: tried that, and it didn&#039;t work either. Any help would be appreciated!

            <Content>Whatcha been lookin&#039; at? ;)

lol I was gonna answer this question quickly and simply, but then I got to the  end of the question. &quot;On a Mac&quot;. Umm..., Idk. Haven&#039;t used one in years, personally prefer PCs. It&#039;s probably not that hard. Firefox should have it on the bar up top, but if you say it&#039;s not there... did you try looking under all the tabs at the options? It&#039;s bound to say something about history somewhere.</Content>
