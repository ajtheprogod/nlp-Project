            <Content>When it comes to ebay with credit cards, it generally only accepts paypal. check the payment methods as theyre always changing when new ones come out, personally i like to pay by cheque or if its big i pay cash when i go pick it up.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>whilst e-Bay recommends Pay-pal, and it is a reasonably safe way of trading, especially with other Non business people, other payment options are often listed.

Most e-bay store will allow credit card payments, private sellers may accept cheques or postal orders.  If you use an alternative you will lose the Pay-pal protection, which is not great but is better than No protection at all.</Content>
