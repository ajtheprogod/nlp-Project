    <Subject>New to twitter...Question about replying to someone else?</Subject>
    <Content>I sent an @reply on twitter, but it&#039;s not showing up on the person&#039;s stream.  Why isn&#039;t it showing up? Does this mean that the reply wasn&#039;t sent?

    <ChosenAnswer>Sending an @reply doesn&#039;t send the tweet directly to that person, it just directs the tweet towards them (useful if you follow a lot of people, and you need to keep track of a conversation in the timeline.)

They can only see you if they are following you.  If they&#039;re following you, they should have gotten it.  Did you click &quot;Reply&quot; at the bottom of their tweet, or just type in @twittername.  Actually clicking the Reply button is what makes a direct tweet in response to the other person&#039;s tweet.  Just typing in @twittername just inserts a link to their page into the tweet.

Just a little insight about twitter, if you know the person is following you, then I can&#039;t see a reason, other than a glitch, that she didn&#039;t get the reply, in which case just retweet, no harm done.</ChosenAnswer>
