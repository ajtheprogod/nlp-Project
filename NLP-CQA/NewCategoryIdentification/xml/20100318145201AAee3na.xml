  <Question id="20100318145201AAee3na" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I find every website I&#039;ve ever signed up for?</Subject>
    <Content>I have been using the internet ever since 2000, signing up to sites and never ever going back to them again. I have also used other email accounts during the past which i were forgotten about. The problem is.... many sites usernames and email accounts etc have been forgotten, but is there a way i can somehow track all this down again? (I have used a number of different computers over the past).

I&#039;ve heard of a website that can generate this list, but my google searches are not resulting in anything.

    <ChosenAnswer>If you think about it, how would this so called website generate such a list if you can&#039;t even remember them?

Think just how many sites have come, gone and been taken over in the last 10 years for a start.

Most sites that have accounts with email addresses that have been dormant over specified time are just deleted. 

They don&#039;t keep them and waste space on their servers on the off chance that your going to come back after a year or two.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>These sites will have left a cookie with you. Only way I can think of - however, I assume before your PC ground to a standstill, you deleted your browsing history. 

Your important sites you have probably added to your favourites/bookmarks - these would have been backed up if you changed hard drives.

Otherwise, keep an A-Z address book of your sites by your PC - note them down with passwords.</Content>

            <Content>That would be handy... but a site like that would need your usernames and passwords which you said you forgot. ALSO it would be a virus looking to ruin your computer, or hack all your info.</Content>
