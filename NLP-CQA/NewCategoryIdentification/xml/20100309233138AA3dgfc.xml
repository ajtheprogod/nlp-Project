            <Content>Perfectly fine. Unsecured wi/fi network just means you don&#039;t need a password to sign into the wi/fi, not that people can more easily access your stuff.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>Of course it&#039;s not! Any WiFi is wide open no matter what you do. It&#039;s a wireless signal.

This was proved on one of the computer/electronic/gadget shows some time ago that WiFi security is absolutely zilch, nada, zero.

They got someone with a laptop with all the normal security etc to go to a WiFi area and work for an hour doing all the normal things you would do.

Unbeknown to them there was a computer security expert on another laptop sitting about a 100 feet away.

After the session they gave the person a complete print out of his activity. 

Every site visited with log in details and passwords, credit and debit card details, what he bought and sold, they even told him how much he had in his bank and what bills he paid.

The only true secure connection to the internet for anything is a hard wired Ethernet connection between your computer/laptop and your modem.

I would never have any wireless connection in my house let alone use it anywhere else.</Content>
