    <ChosenAnswer>Normally, you can check the following settings.
Click on internet option &amp; under connection tab, click on setting after highlighting the connection name.
Click on advanced &amp; uncheck the box which says disconnect when connection may no longer be needed.
Another way is to click on the connection icon in my network connections &amp; click on properties.
Under option tab, put &quot; never&quot; in the box which says idle time before hang up.
I am sure you will find this information of some help to you.</ChosenAnswer>
