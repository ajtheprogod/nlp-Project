    <Subject>Changing address on PayPal (10 points)?</Subject>
    <Content>I am trying, unsucessfully, to edit my address on PayPal. Whenever I try to edit it, all it does is add a new address right above the old one, and it gives the message &quot;(!) To make a change to your address, please select the address you&#039;d like to update and click the &quot;Edit&quot; button below.&quot;. Every time I try editing it, it gives this same stupid answer.

I&#039;m thinking it has something to do with the old address being linked to my bank card or something, but I have already updated my address with the bank. Do I just have to wait a few days and then try again? Am I doing something wrong?

10 points to the person who solves my frustration! :-D

    <ChosenAnswer>Can you delete all the other addresses you have added (including your previous address) and just leave the one you want on there as your primary address?  If this doesn&#039;t work just ring them, their contact number is on the help pages, I&#039;ve rung them a few times, very helpful usually.</ChosenAnswer>
