    <Subject>What&#039;s wrong with Firefox - recently it&#039;s not been opening?</Subject>
    <Content>For the last few days when i double click on the Firefox icon, nothing happens.  I do ctrl, Alt &amp; Delete and it&#039;s showing as running.  I&#039;ve tried ending the process and clicking on it again but it still refuses to open.  If i restart my PC that sometimes fixes the problem.  Is there something i can do about this as it&#039;s taking about 15 mins from first switching my computer on until actually getting on the internet!  Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>Most likely, you stumbled across a javascript loop and it became a memory leak. Click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Mozilla Firefox &gt; Mozilla Firefox (Safe Mode). This will let you access the browser in a safer environment. Then, click TOOLS &gt; Clear Private Data &gt; Clear Private Data Now. 

Close it. Shutdown and reboot your computer.

If this doesnt work then try to reinstall it.</ChosenAnswer>
