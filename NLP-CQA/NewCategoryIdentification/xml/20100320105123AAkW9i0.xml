    <ChosenAnswer>Same for me! It&#039;s ridiculously slow, and I refreshed the page--still nothing! When it finally loaded, a white screen with blue links to parts of the website came up. Then I refreshed the page again, and I got the error &#039;Failed to open page&#039;. Perhaps they&#039;re doing some serious site maintenance.</ChosenAnswer>
