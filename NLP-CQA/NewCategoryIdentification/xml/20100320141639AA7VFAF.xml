    <Subject>Is it better to make a new account or not? Gaia Online?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve had an account on gaia for years, its at least an &#039;06 account. I play the game off an on, usually starting completely over when I come back (most of the people I knew have quit) I think I&#039;ll start again. It would be kind of neat to start completely fresh, no one knowing who I am (I&#039;d move all my expensive stuff over) but then I lose the credit of having an old acount. Should I start over or not?

    <ChosenAnswer>I think it would be better to give me all your gaia money =P

I like gaia but the fact that everything costs so much puts me off, Ive never reached over 1,000 so I dont really use it much anymore. Bugs me that I want my character to look like a Gladiator yet it would take me forever to earn the cash for it.

My answer would be to find a better site with less hastle =)</ChosenAnswer>
