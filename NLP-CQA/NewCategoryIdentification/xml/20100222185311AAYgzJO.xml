Yes, it&#039;s safe and hosted by a good company. No virus can be caught, unless people are emailing you and tell you to download something.
But since it is an inwindow application, their is no virus.
If your mom doesn&#039;t believe you, tell her it&#039;s 100% safe and I should know because I&#039;m really good with computer security like hacking, web protection, and viruses and infections. It&#039;s safe.
