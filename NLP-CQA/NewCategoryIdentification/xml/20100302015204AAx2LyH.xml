    <ChosenAnswer>I don&#039;t see any unlimited plans, who so ever, mobile service provider companies say this is actually fooling us. After a certain limit each and every company is charging a certain amount. If you are looking for a better speed you should go for AirTel, it allows you a 2 GB free internet access and 30p/50kb after that it&#039;s the cheapest in the market. No other provider is doing it so cheap, all of them have some hidden costs. I would recommended  AirTel.</ChosenAnswer>
