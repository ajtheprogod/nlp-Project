            <Content>I see what you mean. The entire site looks unprofessional, unsecure and questionable.  I wouldn&#039;t do business with them either. I read their &quot;Privacy Statement&quot; and some other wordage that just doesn&#039;t sound right either. Don&#039;t like the idea that if you did contact or use their site, your obligated in some way to receive emails from them and others!? They obviously do not guarantee their merchandise as one section relates that if you receive the wrong thing, it&#039;s up to you to return it to them for ?? (this part not clear).  Another section, basically states that once they hand it to the delivery guy it&#039;s game!  They actually say this, that once the merchandise is out of their warehouse, it&#039;s your problem.  They do not list the street address or physical location of their store/warehouse. ALL Businesses give you their address, why doesn&#039;t this site do the same????? 
Another thing that I noticed and gives me a big red flag, is the fact that their &quot;legal&quot; statement, that every site has usually called the &quot;disclaimer&quot; and located at the bottom of the page is missing. A statment within that says that the copyright is for laws in Michigan, yet their store/business, is in Florida?????

Your absolutely right for noticing this and being cautious.</Content>
