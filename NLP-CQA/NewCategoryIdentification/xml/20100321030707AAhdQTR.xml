    <Subject>i found a website where i can make money, is it legal?</Subject>
    <Content>okay so i found a website which seems to let you make really easy money, i signed up 2 days ago and have already made £20. what it involves is sending your friends to a fake id website, and then if they buy one you get paid. i was just wondering that because im not actually selling anything would it be legal to do it?

the website is http://www.yourfakeid.co.uk

    <ChosenAnswer>Do various searches online for keywords such as home based virtual assistant, hire virtual assistant, hire data entry operator or clerk, outsource word processor, outsource data entry .,.. those types of terms should help you locate legitimate companies that hire independent contractors to work from their homes providing administrative type services. You should never have to pay for these types of opportunities ... just as you wouldn&#039;t pay to interview with or apply at a company for a job opening.

            <Content>What you&#039;re doing is not illegal, it&#039;s not very nice though
According to the site this &#039;novelty&#039; item costs £20 and you get 10 %, so that&#039;s 10 &#039;friends&#039; you&#039;ve abused already!

What they&#039;re doing is borderline legal - maybe, and probably illegal if it was investigated properly.
They say it&#039;s a novelty item, but they know full well some underage drinkers will see it as a possible way to flout the law.

That&#039;s assuming this isn&#039;t just fairly plausible spam in the first place</Content>

            <Content>Get into internet marketing, it doesn&#039;t have to cost you a cent.
Get a site, get traffic to it (a separate blog might help here) and all sales you generate are yours.
This  is one example: http://job--listings.info/MyFreeAffiliateSite</Content>
