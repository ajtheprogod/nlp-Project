    <ChosenAnswer>Hello,

I wouldn&#039;t recommend that you give them something like that, the site checked out as bad and I was blocked from reaching it since many users have reported that Gamevance makes unauthorized changes to your computer and gives you malware. I&#039;ve provided a link to a website review in my Source section of my answer that will help you decide; I wouldn&#039;t recommend it though as they could use your ID for illegal deals.
