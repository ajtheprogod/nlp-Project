    <ChosenAnswer>In a way no you are not. Internet Explorer has some other features that allow you to find the password but I would recommend you to use FireFox and get all the information you need. I would need to know the version of the IE and the Windows OS you are using to help more.
Hope this helps...

            <Content>Well the thing is you wouldn&#039;t ever have to block porn if somebody else who has access to your computer goes to see it. So now go to control panel, internet options,and switch everything back to the way it was. Which was probably medium. Maybe you have the Trojan horse virus. Who knows you might need to get it cleaned. 
By the way how are you on Yahoo.com if it won&#039;t let you go on any websites?
So you aren&#039;t FUCKED if you have access to another comp</Content>
