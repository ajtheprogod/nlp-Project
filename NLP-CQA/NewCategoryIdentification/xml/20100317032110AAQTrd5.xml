  <Question id="20100317032110AAQTrd5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I have read messages in my email inbox that I never opened before?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m getting paranoid...the other emails are unread, except for the amazon ones. I use this email to go online shopping too. Should I make a new email account?

    <ChosenAnswer>Perhaps change the password and make sure that you never leave yourself logged in to any account and clear browsing history when using a shared or public computer and don&#039;t ever log in to any sites requiring login or password details if using a proxy. Don&#039;t have an easy to guess password and don&#039;t write it down on a piece of paper left near your computer. If it keeps happening create a new email account for test purposes. If it continues to happen using the new email account run a scan with some security software that can detect key loggers.

If you would like to ensure that your email account remains secure you could always try key scrambler once you have changed the password:

            <Content>I guess you should make a new e-mail address and try and not apply for all sites that send a lot of spam, either that or choose a mail service with a really good spam filter</Content>
