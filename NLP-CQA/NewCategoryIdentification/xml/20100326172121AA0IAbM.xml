    <Subject>If I don&#039;t have a Formspring account, but ask a question, will it be anonymous?</Subject>
    <Content>I don&#039;t have a Formspring account, so it doesn&#039;t provide the &quot;Anonymous&quot; option when I want to ask a question. Will it still be anonymous if I ask a question, even if I ask it while signed on to my Facebook account?

    <ChosenAnswer>Yes it is still anonymous if you ask a question, as long as you are not logged on to a formspring account. Non of your information will be seen, regardless of you being on facebook, because when you want to ask a question, it leads you to the formspring page to ask it.</ChosenAnswer>
