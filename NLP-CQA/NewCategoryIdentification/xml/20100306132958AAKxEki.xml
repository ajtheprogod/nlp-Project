  <Question id="20100306132958AAKxEki" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What does &quot;stand alone manner&quot; mean?</Subject>
    <Content>I found this on a site offering free to use photos:
&quot;You are allowed to copy, distribute, transmit the work and to adapt the work. Attribution is not required. You are prohibited from using this work in a stand alone manner.&quot;

What does this mean -You are prohibited from using this work in a stand alone manner.

In what case is it prohibited to use the photos? 

The additional license says:
&quot;Stand alone basis â€” You can not sell, license, sublicense, rent, transfer or distribute this image exactly as it is without alteration.&quot;

Does this mean  you can crop the photo and then it is OK to use it?

I need to use it for a site.

I need serious answers, please. In case I get a serious professional answer I will give it points.

    <ChosenAnswer>You&#039;ll need to make the photo part of something else.  Crop it, draw a frame around it, do something to it.  Give credit for where you got it, even though the source does not require it.  That&#039;s just good etiquette. What they don&#039;t want you doing is using that photo just on its own, like printing it out and selling it.  Use it to decorate something else, and you&#039;re fine.  It becomes a part of what you&#039;re making.  Use the photo on your website.  That way, it&#039;s a part of the site.</ChosenAnswer>
