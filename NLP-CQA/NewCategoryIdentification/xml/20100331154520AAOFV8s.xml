    <ChosenAnswer>I believe you have to be signed in inorder to ask, however, if you&#039;re not signed in and are able to ask, then yes, it should be posted an annonymous.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yes. You are not signed in, therefore formspring has no way to ask you to sign the question you just asked.
