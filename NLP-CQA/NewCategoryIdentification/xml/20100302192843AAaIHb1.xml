    <ChosenAnswer>No really. But don&#039;t fall for the work at home envelope jobs! Or typing jobs. They are all a scam. If you need some help, you should contact your local government agencies for assistance.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Sorry, that kind of thing does not really exist.  You need to pay to get into sites that pay.  They know they have a good thing and do not give it away.  Anyone who claims to have a free moneymaking site is most likely just trying to scam you.  Be very careful of that.</Content>

            <Content>You might need to spend a few years learning about publishing and advertising and online marketing and then some money will come to you.
You might want to start by creating a website or a blog, then adding content to it, that&#039;s the basis for a platform from where you can then sell ad space.... this is easily done, but you need a site and traffic going to it just concentrate on that and don&#039;t expect to make any money at first.</Content>
