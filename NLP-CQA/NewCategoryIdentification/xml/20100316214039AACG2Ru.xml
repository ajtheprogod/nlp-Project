    <Subject>Once I sell my domain in an auction how do I get it to the buyer?  Do I just transfer it?</Subject>
    <Content>I bought a couple of domains with google domains I no longer need, but they are worth more than just deciding to not renew them.  I&#039;d like to sell them and I have found auctions.  I would like to know what to do before hand so I don&#039;t run into troubles after someone buys it.
