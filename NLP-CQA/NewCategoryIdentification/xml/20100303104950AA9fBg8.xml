    <ChosenAnswer>Your Browser Could be Blocking the Application From running but more than likely you need to install and update your Java and Flash Player Applications. You can get Java and Flash at there websites below. 

http://www.java.com/en/download/

Click the red button that says Free java Download.

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/

uncheck install google toolbar and agree to the terms and install.
