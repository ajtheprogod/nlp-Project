            <Content>You don&#039;t get a reward but you can report them to the FBI Internet Crime reporting site http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx and to Craigslist, as well as the ISP of their email address. If they arent in the US, which they normallly aren&#039;t, nothing will happen. The police or FBI are not going after Nigerian or Russian scammers pulling car scams from overseas</Content>

            <Content>For some reason (maybe someone else knows for sure), many scammers sell goods below $5000, regardless of value. I&#039;ve baited a few selling heavy equipment, like tractors - also on Ebay.
I suspect it has something to do with the sum of money, being tracked or if certain countries have to report sums larger than $5000. Or, it may be a difference between  a &quot;serious crime&quot; vs a misdemeanor in the court&#039;s eye if caught.
Some of these scammers are not too bright, their story is always the same - they are out of the country, the goods are already packaged for shipping (so you can&#039;t view it), etc. I had one on Ebay, selling a tractor for $4400, and he included the serial number. I searched the internet, and found the same tractor in Wisconsin, selling for $44,000 - even the same picture!!! I asked the seller, how he got the tractor from Wisconsin to Vancouver - and mysteriously his ad disappeared within minutes...</Content>
