    <Subject>How to hack Empowering Parents?</Subject>
    <Content>The website &#039;Empowering Parents&#039; makes me really mad, and I would like to hack it, to possibly to prove that we teens are smarter then them, and just make a big announcement on the front page.

    <ChosenAnswer>See, thats not the right way of going about things.

to prove that teenagers are better than them you should build a website that competes with it like

Htttttp://www.  Teens-Are-Bettar-than-U.com or something along the lines

Now why do i say this?

Because
1)By hacking them you&#039;d just be proving their point about how teenagers are brash and irrational.
2)This way you can make more of an impact

and more importantly

3)Because now that you have posted this question and, if by chance, that website got hacked your user would be traced and if by any chance they take it further and find your IP, it will lead to big trouble.


Be logical and cunning, but make sure you stay within the law lol
