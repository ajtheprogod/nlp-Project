    <ChosenAnswer>i&#039;m pretty sure it is, this girl sent me it. it&#039;s a fake porn revenge site where you have to send a link to hella people to get to see more, perfect setup for a virus to spread and to generate traffic. so anyways my friends computer got a nasty virus yesterday, she has no virus protection &amp; it popped up scam software, did let her open any files or do anything other than firefox. i do have virus protection, and it just kept popping up tons trojan viruses. did a full can with avira and it was removed. if you got this then go into safe mode &amp; do system restore for a few days before you opened the site.</ChosenAnswer>
