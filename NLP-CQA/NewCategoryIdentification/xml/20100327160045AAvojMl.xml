    <Subject>Trojan Virus &quot;Trojan-BNK.Win32.Keylogger.geâ€¦?</Subject>
    <Content>A lot of events happened to me, and my computer today. So, I&#039;ll it in chronological order.
I was looking for hacking programs I could use. I know that atlava.com is a trustable site with no viruses, because my other friends and even members in there have no problem.But when I downloaded one trainer (hack pack) for my mmo I noticed there were warnings when I tried opening firefox browser. So, I looked in yahoo answers for programs to delete the virus without having to install &quot;Windows 7 Smart Security 2010&quot; in it&#039;s full version. I downloaded Malware bytes anti malware which a lot of people reccomend from sites such as yahoo answers,youtube,ask.com, and other more sites. So I downloaded it, I stopped when the viruses they detected reached around the 40&#039;s because it took 10 min. So i deleted them, and it told me to restart, and so i did. When it turned on it was blank. I tried using hotkeys to guide me somewhere till a miracle happened and I came back on again. SO.... now I am scanning the malware again in it&#039;s full range scan, right now it detected nothing, but the win 7 smart security 2010 program still detects this virus WTF? it&#039;s fricken annoying, because it would ask me if i want to activate the program win 7 smart security 2010 every 1 min. Also, if I press to continue to keep using windows with the virus on, an automatic windows explorer pops up loading with a page, and I just keep closing it right away. It&#039;s really annoying. so many programs pop up. Malware says theres nothing to worry about while the win 7 smart is like a pop up ad opening every 1 min. You may not know this but it took me a long time to type this because i had to close the waning securities every 3 sentences I write. someone try helping mehz :P thanks.
