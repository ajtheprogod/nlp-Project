    <Subject>ebay Warranty Question?</Subject>
    <Content>I live in Canada, and I am thinking of buying an iPod Touch. I have found some good deals on ebay, and a lot of which come with warranty. However, someone said that if the product is coming from the United States, the warranty won&#039;t be valid in Canada. Is that true?
I already have a good phne, Colin, but thanks for answering my question. So helpful. NOT!
