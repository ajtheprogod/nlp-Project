  <Question id="20100226124459AAOIWe2" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Did you redeem 3rd wave on lockerz for get your ptz back?</Subject>
    <Content>Apparently people used bots 3rd wave. So all the people that did not get a prize got 100 pointz back!

What do you think about the bot users? At least today we will get a chance to log on because there is no time given for the bots to go on. 

I&#039;m using lockeralerts which texts me the time it starts.

Thats not cheating because others still have a chance. What are your guys gonna try to redeem today?

    <ChosenAnswer>Thats cool I&#039;ve never heard of lockeralerts. In my case when I tried logging in at 10 the other day the site was so overloaded and slow it took me half an hour to log in and everything was fresh out except the wallpapers. I think people who use bots should be banned its just unfair to people who will never get a chance to grab the &quot;cool&quot; prizes.</ChosenAnswer>
