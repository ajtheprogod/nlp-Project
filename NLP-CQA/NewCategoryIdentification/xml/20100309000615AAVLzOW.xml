            <Content>I normally stick to computers and internet, mainly security..cause thats what I do... but sometimes, just sometimes... I&#039;ll see a question that just begs for me to troll them, and I can&#039;t resist. When I get the call, I&#039;ll go to whatever category I have to in order to get the lulz.</Content>
