    <ChosenAnswer>Those darn Christians.. always so funny :).....i noticed there&#039;s no Sex addiction listed.. just Homosexuality .... The bible also mentions if your kids should disobey you.. you should take them outside and STONE Them to death. People love to just accept what they like outta the bible.. and edit out what they see fit.

Maybe they outta add Pedophilia to that list.. the Priests seem to own that market.. they&#039;re quite exceptional at it.</ChosenAnswer>
