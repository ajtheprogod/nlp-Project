    <ChosenAnswer>You might not be a professional but they might want to use you as a point of contact seeing that you are a secretary, ie please contact my secretary!

If so, there is not a lot you can do about it. You are just an employee in the system.

If you refuse, they could insist which then only leaves you the option of asking to be moved to a backroom department or leave.

Seeing how the employment market is at the moment in the UK not a good idea.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yes, you can keep your ID somewhat private.  Here is how you can accomplish it:

1. Do not select the option for a public profile and your profile will not be searchable on the web. However people on LinkedIn can still find you.

2. You can set your profile display name to only show your first name and last initial instead of your full last name.</Content>
