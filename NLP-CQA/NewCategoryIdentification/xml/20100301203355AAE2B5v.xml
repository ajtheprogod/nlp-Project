  <Question id="20100301203355AAE2B5v" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I actually contact ebay?</Subject>
    <Content>I bought an item, a Nintendo DS game, when it arrived it was a faulty, illegal copy, so I requested a refund. The seller agreed, so we sent it back and haven&#039;t heard back or received a refund. It&#039;s too late to leave feedback, the seller doesn&#039;t reply to emails, we have no messages containing the item listing OR the seller&#039;s username, and I can&#039;t directly contact ebay because they put you through a ridiculous topic-sub-topic system that doesn&#039;t work. Anybody know how I can directly contact them?

    <ChosenAnswer>Ok, I&#039;m not trying to make my answer sound complicated, but you have more than one issue to consider. First, did you send the item back to the seller with delivery confirmation? You should always do that, so you can prove that the seller got it back. Also, I&#039;d suggest sending the seller a message through eBay&#039;s messaging system, listing everything that&#039;s gone on so far. Or, if it&#039;s not too late, go ahead and start a dispute with PayPal/eBay. You can access live chat here, if you want to speak directly to an eBay agent: http://pages.ebay.com/help/basics/n-livehelpemail.html

As far as knowing the seller&#039;s username/name &amp; address, that&#039;s easy enough to find (again, if it&#039;s not too late). Look at this page to find out their real identity, use this link, and read this section: To request your seller&#039;s contact information: http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/contact.html

Let me caution you to not get into a confrontational situation with them, no one wants that.

I hope this helps you, I hate to see people get ripped off.

Good luck!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>you could try ebays live help, they might be able to assist. 

How long ago was this? If its too late ebay might not be able to assist, do you still have the sellers real name &amp; address (the address used to send it back) perhaps you can lodge a complaint with the police fraud dept.</Content>
