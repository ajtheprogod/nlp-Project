    <Subject>Saved Passwords in Google Chrome?</Subject>
    <Content>On a certain site, my friend was using my comp. and typed in his password to a site, and then when asked clicked on &quot;Never Remember Passwords On This Site&quot;.  However I really want my password to be remembered.  Is there a way to reverse this?

Thanks

    <ChosenAnswer>Go to Options, Personal Stuff TAB, Clear Browsing History &amp; clear everything to start from scratch. You cannot just undo that one action your friend did.

Edit:
Contrary to another answer, you do not need to change the &quot;Save Password&quot; setting because you want to use it for the same website. Clicking the &quot;Never Remember ....&quot; disabled saving passwords for that website &amp; that cannot be reversed.</ChosenAnswer>
