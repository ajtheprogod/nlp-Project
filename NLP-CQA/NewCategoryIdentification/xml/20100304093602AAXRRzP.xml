    <ChosenAnswer>I wouldn&#039;t trust it considering some of the prices on the front page.  If you&#039;re wanting to do something like that, use:

http://www.swoopo.com/

I know that this site is legit.  You have to use money to buy a certain amount of &quot;bids,&quot; then you use those bids to buy items cheaper.  For example, you want a new macbookpro (mine cost $2,300 from apple.com), if you go on swoopo, you can pay $45 for 75 bids, then you can watch a macbookpro sell, and everytime you bid, it takes away a bid (duh).  So you can use all 75 bids on a macbook pro and win, but only have to pay what the bid went up to.  So if the bid only went up to like $20 and you won, then you just got a macbook pro for $65.  It&#039;s a great investment (go on there, buy expensive stuff for cheap, then resell at near full price).  The reason it is so cheap is because they buy things in bulk or have things donated, then with thousands of people spending money on bids, but not winning stuff, they get more than enough profit per item.</ChosenAnswer>
