    <Subject>How do I delete a song from an Itunes playlist but keep it in the library?</Subject>
    <Content>I was just transfering some new purchases to playlists on Itunes and I accidentally put it in the wrong place. I tried to uncheck it in that list but when I do it unchecks in the play list that I want it in as well.
