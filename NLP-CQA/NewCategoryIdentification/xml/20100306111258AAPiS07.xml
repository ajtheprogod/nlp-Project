  <Question id="20100306111258AAPiS07" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can you pay Livejournal to unblock your account?</Subject>
    <Content>Livejournal suspended my account for unclear reasons, and I they haven&#039;t got back to me for the past two weeks despite several emails. I was wondering if it would be easier to just pay LJ to release my account if that was possible. I have a ton of stuff on there going back to 2004 that I&#039;d like to get back.
