    <ChosenAnswer>Hmmm.  Were you looking at something that you shouldn&#039;t have been?  Maybe take this as a lesson learned?

Anyway, you didn&#039;t say if this was a Mac or a Windows machine.  Here&#039;s what I&#039;d do for each (sorry, I don&#039;t know Vista or Windows 7):

WindowsXP:
Hit control-alt-delete to bring up the Windows Task Manager.  
Click on the &quot;Applications&quot; button.
Highlight Firefox
Hit the &quot;End Task&quot; button

Mac:
Click on the Firefox icon
Hit apple-Q to force-quit FF

If none of that works and your computer isn&#039;t completely hung, another option is to go save the other stuff and simply reboot the machine.</ChosenAnswer>
