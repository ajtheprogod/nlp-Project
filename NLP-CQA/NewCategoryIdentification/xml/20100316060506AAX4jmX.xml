    <Subject>Mozilla Firefox Not working, But Internet Exploer Is...  How Do I Get Mozilla To Work Again?</Subject>
    <Content>I tried updating my Mozilla Firefox and that worked at first.  It was slow to log on, but it got me on.  However, since then when I click on the icon on my desk top the hour glass comes on and then disappears.  The program to make it work is running, but it won&#039;t actually work.  How can I actually get on Mozilla Firefox again.
Do I have to remove the Mozilla Fire Fox first?  I thought updating it at the site (using Internet Explorer to get there) automatically did that.  Yes, I updated it that way already.  I feel this could be a sign of something bigger...  What do you think?
ZOOMJET!  You Are Correct.... This suggestion worked!   &quot;Open task manager (press CTRL+ALT+DEL together) and under the processes tab look for firefox.exe - if it&#039;s there, right click-&gt;end process.&quot;.... .  
Thank you so much!
ZoomJet..  If you could, please tell us in your answer how this happpened and how we can prevent this from happening again.. Thanks

    <ChosenAnswer>First make sure firefox is not running in memory

open task manager (press CTRL+ALT+DEL together) and under the processes tab look for firefox.exe - if it&#039;s there, right click-&gt;end process.

Try opening firefox in safe mode

go to start-&gt;all programs-&gt;mozilla firefox-&gt;safe mode

if firefox opens normally, it suggests a bad add-on - possibly an extension or toolbar - go to Tools-&gt;add-ons and disable or uninstall any you think may be the cause of the problem

also (with firefox still open) press CTRL+SHIFT+DEL together and clear history, cookies and cache

Close firefox (safe mode) and try opening it normally. Good luck.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>In firefox go to &quot;file&quot; then at the bottom of the drop down menu it says &quot;work offline&quot;  if there is a check next to &quot;work offline&quot; then you will be working offline.  To amend this just click &quot;work offline&quot; and that will remove the check mark and you should be good.</Content>
