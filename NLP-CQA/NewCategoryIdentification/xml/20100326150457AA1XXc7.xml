    <ChosenAnswer>If I remember rightly they charge a small fee to your bank account and there is a code number in the transaction. Once you check your bank statement and verify these code numbers back to them they deduct the charge. It does make things safer for everyone as only you should have access to your bank account statement. Took about 4 days for me to check my statement online.
