    <ChosenAnswer>When you get a refund, it is almost always returned to you in the exact same manner as you paid for it.

So, in this case, if you paid using your play.com account, then you probably will see your refund on your play.com account. If you paid using a credit card, you will see the refund on your credit card statement.

If you paid using a debit card, the refund will go into your bank account.

Hope that helps!</ChosenAnswer>
