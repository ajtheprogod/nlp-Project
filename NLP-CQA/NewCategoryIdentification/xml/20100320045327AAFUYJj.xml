    <ChosenAnswer>download aa program called cc cleaner and run a scan on all your programs to delete all your cache and cookies Etc, the run a scan on your registry with cc cleaner to see if that helps.

then download the free version of malware anti bytes from  http://www.malwarebytes.org/

you might have to copy and paste            http://www.malwarebytes.org/           into the address bar, download the free version of that and run it also.

after the computer restarts, if you still can not get it working better, maybe it is a problem with your internet connection, maybe your router - it might just be a very slow connection - try running a ping test.

go to your start bar and find Run, type in cmd and press enter


then in the black box type in ping www.google.com - this will tell you how fast your connection is basically.

at the bottom it will minimum = xxx and maximum = xxx and average = xxx

if your average is over 100ms then you will have quite a slow internet connection, if it is really high like 250ms then you would suffer from Images not loading.

if you have a normal speed like 10ms or something then i dont know what to suggest</ChosenAnswer>
