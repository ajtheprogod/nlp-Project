    <ChosenAnswer>January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UDT (the time in London) is the time many computer dates are calculated from, where a number is the number of seconds from this time. So this particular time is the timestamp 0.

So December 31, 1969 is what day it was for time 0 in timezones west of London. Because of this, if software uses a date that is not defined, it is interpreted as 0, and therefor shown as December 31, 1969.

So basically, the Firefox update didn&#039;t specify the timestamp correctly, and so the time showed up way in the past.</ChosenAnswer>
