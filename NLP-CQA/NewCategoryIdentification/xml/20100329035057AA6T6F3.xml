            <Content>More information is required to answer this question.

Small Packet is not a service - its a type of mail item, like letter, parcel, etc.

We need to know which Royal Mail service was used to answer.
Here&#039;s a list of the Royal Mail services that give you a tracking number -
(International)
Airsure
International Signed For Airmail
International Signed For Surface Mail
(UK only)
Special Delivery
Recorded Signed For 1st Class
Recorded Signed For 2nd Class


The following do NOT have a tracking number:
(International)
Airmail
Surface Mail
(UK only)
1st Class
2nd Class


You need to check with the seller which service they used. There is no &quot;standard&quot; service. This is usually a word that ebay sellers use to mean &quot;whatever is cheapest&quot;.</Content>
            <Reference>I&#039;m a Royal Mail postman - I also used to work in a Royal Mail office that processed international mail.</Reference>
