    <ChosenAnswer>Nothing is totally safe or private especially if it isn&#039;t encrypted. I would suggest you steer clear of any of the add-on software available as it is all third-party stuff that is likely to contain at the very least, spyware.

You can only message people who&#039;s Skype ID you know.They may or may not see your message if they aren;t your friend depending how they have their settings.

I am not sure what you mean by safe so I can&#039;t say.

In terms of privacy, well, if you were planning some terrible illegal activity then no it will not offer suffieient privacy.

For other purposes it is as private as any other similar service.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yeah it is pretty safe and private as long as you completely trust the person on the other side. But, if you just message/call the other person you will be all right. Yeah, a phone call is sent out and the person either accepts it or declines it or they could just not be there and that is that. Have fun skyping, it is pretty cool.</Content>
