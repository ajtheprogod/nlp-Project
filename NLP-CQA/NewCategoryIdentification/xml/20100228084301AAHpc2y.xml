    <ChosenAnswer>ebay.com is owned by PayPal.
Its the worlds biggest online auction website.

Bidding or agreeing to buy/sell anything on there is a legally binding agreement.
If you dont get the product then they have a disputes department.

Make sure you are buying from a person with a high rating and high &quot;Positive feedback&quot; percentage and you should be fine as alot of people with high ratings and feedbacks actually have &quot;real life&quot; shops too or work by selling things direct from the manufacturers.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>What&#039;s the question, anyhow? I&#039;m an eBay member and have been for over 10 years. I don&#039;t buy a lot, and I&#039;m careful to bid only on something that I really want and can afford to pay for. I don&#039;t know anything about lockerz or whatever that is. 

Yes, you have to have money to pay for the things you bid on and win in eBay. Again, I don&#039;t know about lockerz, but I think it has something to do with YouTube.</Content>

            <Content>im not so sure about ebay, but based on everyone elses answers i can tell that you have gotten alot about ebay and not much on about lockerz. i am a active lockerz user and you dont have to pay for anything at all. for more in formation click on the link below, and for those who have not signed up to the site just send my an email with your email address so i can invite you to the site. dont worry the link is not a virus or any sort of malware its just a video with a great explanantion.
