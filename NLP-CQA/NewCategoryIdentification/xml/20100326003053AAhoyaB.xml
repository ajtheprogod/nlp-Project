    <Subject>How to prevent video ads?</Subject>
    <Content>I know there&#039;s software out there to do this, but I don&#039;t want to download it if I have another option. I&#039;m using Firefox, 3.6.2 I think, and on a site, there&#039;s more than one, I use most every time I&#039;m on the internet I ALWAYS get video ads. They start randomly and it becomes very annoying when I&#039;m listening to music, and I don&#039;t like clicking on them to make them stop. I&#039;m also on a laptop and I know ads like these eat at the time left on my battery. So if there&#039;s some option given to me by Firefox or you have a software/download you&#039;d recommend (please don&#039;t give me a recommendation you or someone you know hasn&#039;t tried) please let me know. Thank you ^^

~Totally unrelated, but has anyone been having problems with applying your custom personas? Mine won&#039;t work ever since the new Firefox two days ago. ;(

    <ChosenAnswer>There are two add-ons, Adblock Plus and Adblock Plus Element Hider. This two add-ons help speed up browsing by blocking not just the video(.swf file) ads but also texted and pictured ads.
I am using both since Firefox 3.0
You can find them by searching in firefox add-on site.

And for your second question you have to reinstall firefox.
