            <Content>Lockerz is, sadly, a scam using the natural desire to get something for nothing.

The business model they claim to hold is completely unsustainable, because unless they&#039;re making a huge amount of money somewhere along the line, there&#039;s no way they can send out the invitingly high-end game consoles in the Lockerz Store... for free, to anyone who happens to have between 250 and 500 points. The mechanics just don&#039;t work.

Consider giving out expensive electronics from your porch to everyone who puts a slip of paper on your doorstep. Would that work for very long? Neither would Lockerz.</Content>
