    <Subject>Problems with Firefox before and after the 3.6 update?</Subject>
    <Content>Has anyone else&#039;s browsers been messing up in the last month?
It&#039;s driving me mad!  I have to send emails to professors sometimes at deadlines that are quickly approaching, and I write a good solid email and then... &quot;whoops.&quot;  So I learned to keep copying my letter just in case.  Well, for whatever reason, when I restart the browser, I can&#039;t paste...

This is starting to get to the point of irritation.  I love firefox&#039;s customizable options and I&#039;m considering switching to another browser that is similar.  Which one should I choose?  I&#039;m not interested in the bare simplicity of &quot;Opera&quot; nor the stupidity of &quot;Safari.&quot;  I definitely don&#039;t want &quot;Explorer&quot; again.
EDIT:
I have Windows 7.

    <ChosenAnswer>I was getting that issue also but my problem had to do with the security system I had, it had incompatibility issues with it. I would definitely advise reverting back to the earlier version of firefox and it most likely will rectify the issue.
REM: When uninstalling 3.6 keep your cookies,history etc so that when you install back the 3.5.8 you would be able to find your information.

Google chrome I hear is good, however it depends on what you use the browsers to do. If you are building websites in languages like asp, it is not advisable.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I haven&#039;t had any issues with Firefox 3.6 on my Windows install. I&#039;m still using 3.5 on my Linux partition, no trouble there either. 

Been experimenting with Chrome of late.</Content>

            <Content>Yes you are not the only one with this problem. 3.6 seems to run great with windows 7 but not so well with XP. You should be able to sort this problem by completely un-installing 3.6 and get 3.58. here.http://www.oldapps.com/firefox.php?old_firefox=75

            <Content>I&#039;m still using version 3.5 because I&#039;m using Linux. But everyone who I know that is using Windows and upgraded to 3.6 has been having troubles. 

You could always try Chrome as a browser.</Content>
