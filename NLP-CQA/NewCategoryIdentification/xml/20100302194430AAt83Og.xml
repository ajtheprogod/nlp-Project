  <Question id="20100302194430AAt83Og" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is gozilla.com a safe site?</Subject>
    <Content>I was browsing another site of mine when I accidentally clicked one of those mini google ad links and it brought me to gozilla.com. I&#039;m not saying there is anything wrong on my computer but I get very paranoid about accidentally clicking links to unknown sites.

Nothing is wrong with my computer and all I did was, it went to the page and I clicked &quot;back&quot; in about like 3 seconds with being on the page. Is this site safe? And even if it wasn&#039;t could it do harm to my computer from being on it for 3 seconds?
It wasn&#039;t a google sponsored link, it was just a sponsored link for IMDB.com, is it safe?
It may have also been Gozzillaflix.com, is that one safe?

            <Content>It should be okay. McAfee Siteadviser and Norton Safe Web say so.
gozillaflix.com is also safe according to those same sites.</Content>
