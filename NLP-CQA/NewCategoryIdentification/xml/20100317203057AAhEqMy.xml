    <ChosenAnswer>I put in the specs for my old laptop, and was quoted $122.  After I sent it in, they changed their offer to $60.  They said the battery didn&#039;t  work (it worked before I sent it in), that the Microsoft key sticker was too worn (it was faded but still legible), and that the RAM was half of what it really was.  I upgraded the RAM myself to double the original amount.  There is no way to dispute their findings, just take it or leave it.  I took my laptop back and sold it on ebay for $232.  Oh, and when I got it back from gazelle, the battery no longer worked.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I sent in 7 phones. The online quote was for $170...got $182. Looks like I was a little too rough on my own grading. They were quick and very responsive. I plan on using them again.</Content>

            <Content>It&#039;s legit. I&#039;ve sold 3 phones from them and got the price I was quoted or better. Plus there are coupons online to get 10% more. And their customer service has been quick and helpful for me.</Content>
