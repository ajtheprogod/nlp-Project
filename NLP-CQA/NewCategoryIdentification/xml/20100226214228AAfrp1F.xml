    <Subject>My Firefox Add-Ons disappeared and some websites won&#039;t work either after laptop shutdown failure!?</Subject>
    <Content>After my stupid laptop battery fell off my laptop, I insert it back in and turned back on. All of a sudden, when Firefox appeared on start-up, All of my Add-ons disappeared and websites like last.fm won&#039;t work when I click the &quot;Add To My Library Button&quot;. Does anybody know the solution to this issue? My computer is a Windows Vista 7 and I also tried finding files:extensions.ini, extensions.cache and extensions.rdf, but they are nowhere in my Firefox directory. Especially with Hidden Files and Folders enabled. I am also too lazy to reinstall my add-ons and extensions.
