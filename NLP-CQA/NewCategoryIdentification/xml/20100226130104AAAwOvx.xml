    <Subject>Should I get a formspring?</Subject>
    <Content>I don&#039;t really want one, but think it will be interesting to see what people ask me. A lot of my friends have one.
Do I have to answer all the questions that are asked?

    <ChosenAnswer>you should get one but i heard it causes a lot of drama lol
i have one though.
and no you don&#039;t have to answer all the questions
all questions your asked are sent to your &#039;inbox&#039; on formspring and you can choose which questions you want to answer.
if you don&#039;t want to answer some of the questions you can just delete it.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I have one and I must admit it&#039;s really exciting when you get new questions. Some of the questions people ask you are interesting, although some are innoproproate, depending on where you &#039;advertise&#039; your formspring. (eg. facebook, twitter etc.) I recommend getting one, and if you don&#039;t like it you can just not use it anymore!</Content>
