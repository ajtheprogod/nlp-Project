  <Question id="20100314223144AAIPQvn" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I dont know what I want to be :(?</Subject>
    <Content>I want to work in the medical field as a Doctor, I want to conduct research and make medical breakthoughs but I also want to own my own businesses or run a large corporation I founded etc... I know these are big goals but I know for a fact that I want to achieve both in my life. I dont even know where to start... Well I know school comes first but once I get my degree in philosophy and get accepted into medical school(getting 100% of my tuition paid by the united states army&#039;s HPSP program) I dont even know what type of doctor I want to be. I know for a fact I want to get paid well even though its not about the money I want a comfortable lifestyle and I dont want to be on call 24/7 etc... I want to be able to work and own a business... Im so worried that time is slipping past me...
