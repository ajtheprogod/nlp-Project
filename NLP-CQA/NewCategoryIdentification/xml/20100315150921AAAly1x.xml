    <ChosenAnswer>Lots of people will tell you different things. But I suggest you first check what ebay tells you are the hottest things to sell on eBay (afterall, they&#039;ve got the data and the most information)

Items In Demand = the most popular items currently within that particular category. To see the In Demand page, go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/sell… 

Hot Items by Category Report = a monthly report that lists the fastest growing categories on eBay for the previous month. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/what… and select &quot;Hot Items by Category&quot; from the menu on the left. 

eBay Pulse = &quot;a daily snapshot of current trends, hot picks, and cool stuff on eBay&quot;. Go to http://pulse.ebay.com/ to see eBay Pulse in action. 

Merchandising Calendar = eBay promotes specific categories on its home page each month. Savvy eBayers know that this home page exposure results in more interest in such categories. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/cale… to view the current Merchandising Calendar.</ChosenAnswer>
