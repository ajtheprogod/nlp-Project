  <Question id="20100226045700AAspfIL" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How is it possible to make money online as a job opposed to home based business.?</Subject>
    <Content>Just like a job. Here&#039;s a task that I need done. This is what I&#039;ll pay you to do it. People go to offices everyday of the week, and THEY sit at their desk in front of a computer and get paid a salary. Can I please have all the advice on this subject as physically possible. Thank you so much

    <ChosenAnswer>Well, everyone works differently, but I work best by getting a book from the library, or a bookstore, or even borrowing one, reading it, and just trying it out on my own.

You can hire a tutor, use a book, online tutorials, ask others you know who are programmers to help, etc.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You could write, I used to do that, or use GPTHQ - it&#039;s just like data entry, form filling type stuff but it&#039;s not too bad. They update it a lot, it&#039;s free - a few hours a day you&#039;d probably get $90 odd.</Content>
