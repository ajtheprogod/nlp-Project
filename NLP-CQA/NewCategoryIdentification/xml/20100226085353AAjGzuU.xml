    <Subject>Weird thing that happened...did a virus copy my files?</Subject>
    <Content>I have Pest Patrol. I was using the internet and all of a sudden a message flashed up saying I have a virus and a box came up with a progress bar as if my E (flash drive) was being downloaded by someone. I unplugged my flash drive very quickly (before the progress bar finished) and x-ed out of internet. What are the odds that someone was actually able to copy my files?
