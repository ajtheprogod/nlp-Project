  <Question id="20100315182434AAY0IHQ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why can&#039;t I put more then one set of clothes on my Marapets character/avatar?</Subject>
    <Content>Yeah.
I go and select the item I want to wear in my closet, then go back and select another.
But the second item I select is the only one that stays on, the first one doesn&#039;t.
Help?
I&#039;m new to Mara pets, I just joined yesterday. So I&#039;m not sure how to do a lot of things.

    <ChosenAnswer>There are several things you might be doing here.

1-When you click the clothing item, it shows your character with one bit of clothing, do you press &quot;Update Character&quot;? Then the first item will stay on.

2-Even if you do that, when you preview the next item, it will show just one until you press &quot;Update Character&quot; and then both items should stay on.

3-You may only wear one top, one bottom, one shoes and one wig at a time, so if you put a different top on, you don&#039;t keep the first top on.</ChosenAnswer>
