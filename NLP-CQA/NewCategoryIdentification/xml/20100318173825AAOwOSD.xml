    <Subject>Can I delete my Twitter account?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve got an old twitter account I want to delete. Is there any way of getting rid of it other then removing all of my tweets and followers, etc? (Because that would take FOREVER.)

            <Content>Deactivatng your account permanently removes your profile from Twitter.  Note that deactivated profiles may take up to 30 days to clear from our internal systems. While the deactivation is being completed, usernames or email addresses cannot be used in the creation of new accounts.  If you wish to use your username or email address with a future account, be sure to change them in your Settings page before you deactivate your account.  You can deactivate your account from your account settings page by clicking &quot;Deactivate my account&quot; at the bottom.</Content>
