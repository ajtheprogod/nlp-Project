    <ChosenAnswer>You don&#039;t have to pay more pointz to get into the redemption time unless you choose to participate in the member redemption. The Member Redemption simply increases your chances of receiving the prize you want.

I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re asking here, but no, you don&#039;t have to bid on pointz.

Yes, there is a chance you won&#039;t get the prize you want because there is a limited stock of items at Lockerz.</ChosenAnswer>
