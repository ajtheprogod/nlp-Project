  <Question id="20100402021416AAS28f0" type="Answered">
    <Subject>is there a simple way to repair internet explorer 8 that a novice can do?</Subject>
    <Content>before i continue i would like to point out  : i dont have any spare discs or cds to copy anything on to.

and system restore was turned off up until very recently  so i can&#039;t use that method.







i downloaded some not very good programs recently ( quero  and privoxy )  and when i uninstalled them, i noticed changes to my internet explorer 8 browser - the go buttons , the arrows for back and forward have disappeared .

the address bar has disappeared , and the google toolbar has disappeared and it won&#039;t let me reinstall it.


i dont know what else to do to get my browser back to how it was, so i thought if i uninstall internet explorer 8 , that might work ?

but i was wondering would i lose all my favourites in the favourites bar or the favourites bar itself ?


anyone know or have any idea ?


if i uninstall internet explorer 8 will i lose my favourites bar in the browser and everything saved in it ?


or how can i restore my internet explorer 8 browser and get the go buttons back, the address bar ,  and the google toolbar ?
