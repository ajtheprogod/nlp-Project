    <ChosenAnswer>Sounds like a scam, if it is a genuine auction you have to be the highest bidder to win. Unless there is a &quot;Buy it now&quot; button to buy immediately then it is not genuine. Ebay members do not give out their phone numbers during auctions. 

Steer clear of offers like this to buy &quot;off Ebay&quot;, he probaby is selling a fake/dud item and has had no bids and is getting desperate. You will not have buyer protection and could lose your money and never receive the item and you will have no comeback through Ebay or Paypal.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>That sounds like a scam. If there&#039;s no &quot;buy it now&quot; option, don&#039;t do it.</Content>
