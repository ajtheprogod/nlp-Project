    <Subject>Problem opening/saving a file from the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>I need to download a file from the Board of Ed. The windows that pop up give me the option to run save or cancel the file. I tried saving it first and accessing it from my computer, it opened up a new window but instead of displaying the data another window popped up to  download the file again. So I tried running the file. No luck. Any tips out there for me?

    <ChosenAnswer>You may have actually saved the &#039;link&#039; to the file.  When you save the file, make sure that you look at the name and type of file you are saving.

That would explain why you open this file and it wants to save the file again.  You actually were opening the link that you downloaded and saved.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Make sure you have the program that it needs installed on your machine. For example if it&#039;s a PDF file you must have Adobe Reader to open the file, if it&#039;s a .doc file you need Microsoft Word. Try saving it directly to your desktop and opening it again.</Content>
