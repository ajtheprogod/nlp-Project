    <ChosenAnswer>This link says it all. I don&#039;t know what happened but the proof of it is here. Please note that I&#039;d really rather not post the link, you&#039;ll see why as you read this. 
Someone posted the link on my Formspring and I answered with the following:
&quot;How dare you exploit someone like that.
To anyone reading this don&#039;t go on the website. This person posted this link because they want to see nude pics of some girl that has a beef with the website&#039;s creator. It&#039;s a revenge website and an exploitation of the Internet for harmful purposes.
Seriously? Come on. Perv.&quot;</ChosenAnswer>
