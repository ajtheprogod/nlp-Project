    <Subject>How can I unblock Port 25?</Subject>
    <Content>Comcast recently did an area wide blocking of the outgoing mail port 25 due usage of this port by spammers. I have a mail client that does not allow configuration of outgoing mail ports. I do not need to know how to change Outlook&#039;s settings, just how to unblock it manually or contact Comcast with my request (and if they will grant it).

Thank you
I will repeat: I do not need to know how to change Outlook&#039;s settings

    <ChosenAnswer>You will need to use a private SMTP service to bypass the port 25 block and not your email server that doesn&#039;t support anything beyond port 25. There is no way around this.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>comcast will not grant your request to open up port 25 unless you are running a MX server (mail exchange server) more than likely you are using another configuration for an email account other than comcasts. you can try using SSL 443 and not 25.</Content>

            <Content>Comcast provides you with their SMTP server on port 25 to use. Set your client&#039;s smtp server to smtp.comcast.net and tell it to use your Comcast username and password to log onto the smtp server.</Content>
