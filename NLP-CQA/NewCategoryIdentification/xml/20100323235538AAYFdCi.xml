  <Question id="20100323235538AAYFdCi" type="Answered">
    <Subject>My laptop suddenly stopped connecting to the Internet (dial-up)... read details....?</Subject>
    <Content>^even though there aren&#039;t a whole lot of details to read......

I use dial-up. 

It works just fine on all other computers, so there&#039;s nothing wrong with the phone wire. If I plug it into my laptop and try connecting, it still makes one of the sounds that indicate that there&#039;s a phone wire there - If I pull the plug, that sound stops. It just says I failed to connect to the Internet, and returns with no known errors. 

It did recently have to be formatted and reinstalled. It has Windows Vista on it, (Vista = fail; 32bit XP still = pwn [what else am I supposed to program in 8086 DOS machine code on?])  and always has. 

It used to connect fine, even after being reinstalled. It just one day stopped working. I did a system restore, and it still didn&#039;t work. 

Any help is greatly appreciated...... My guy (or, girl, rather; mages can only be girls in this game)  in an MMORPG is getting old and is still only level 11 &gt;.&lt;  I&#039;m stuck playing MORTS&#039;s in odd chairs and I&#039;ll die under these conditions soon!!!! I need to play some MMORPG to practice my l33tz, too!! I&#039;ll look really dumb if I try that in a strategy game..... (&quot;lulz u|^ k|\|18h4s |^ /\/0 m4t&lt;h f0|^ mY l33tz h/-\x0r sk1llz,,,,, /-\nD $P34rm3/\/3n... /\/0 /\/\4t&lt;h f0|^ 4h3m 31t|^3r&quot; would make we get laughed at, because in the time it would take me to type that all out, his knights would have stood a chance against my l33tz haxor skillz and spearmen &gt;.&lt;)


Any further information required, ask please!!
@Phil,
I can&#039;t get faster Internet here, so there&#039;s only one person who has it... and it&#039;s horribley slow Satellite Internet... and no, I am not hiding behind a rock in their backyard just to use it. Dial-up works just fine. To be honest, I don&#039;t care that it&#039;s gonna take 20 hours to download this file - I&#039;ll just leave it running overnight... maybe even the next night.
