  <Question id="20100329045237AABpUXl" type="Answered">
    <Subject>are there any decent ad blockers for internet explorer?</Subject>
    <Content>when i first signed up for an account in late 2006 on yahoo answers, i dont remember &#039; ever &#039; seeing any intrusive, distracting advertisements - over the last year or so it seems now they are a fixed , permanent feature.

i find them distracting and annoying at best . i despise them.

ive managed to block them on google chrome useing an ad block, ive also blocked them on firefox , but there are tons of ad ons on firefox it keeps freezing and doesn&#039;t operate too well.

but i notice the ads are still showing on internet explorer , i thought i blocked them with a host file, blocker - but the ads are still managing to show through..


is there any effective way i can block the ads through internet explorer ?

i really dont like them, i resent their presence and they ruin my enjoyment of yahoo answers.

    <ChosenAnswer>I don&#039;t use Internet Explorer for it&#039;s lack of protection and abilities in this department. I would suggest changing browsers before trying ad ons for that with IE. Try Firefox and then install the add-on called NoScript. It gives you the ability to allow or block anything on the page you are looking at. I been using it for years and swear by it.</ChosenAnswer>
