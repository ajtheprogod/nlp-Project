    <Subject>do Bigpond customers get free downloads off steam?</Subject>
    <Content>I know that internode customers get free downloads from the internode servers and 3fl from the 3fl servers, but do BigPond customers get free downloads off any servers?

I&#039;ve noticed there is a Telstra server located in NSW, but will that give free downloads for an SA customer?

By the way, I dont mean like free games I mean will it count towards the download usage for the month.
