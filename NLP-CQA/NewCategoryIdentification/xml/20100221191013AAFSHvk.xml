    <Subject>What should I do? Ebay question need help?</Subject>
    <Content>Hey I bought something for my dad for his birthday on ebay. I talked to the seller and planned on paying with a money order. It has been over a week since I won the item and I have sent him several emails and have not received a response. His birthday is approaching and I&#039;m not sure what to do. Is there a certain period in which the seller must give you the info to pay? I&#039;m thinking of ordering one from someone else but what would happen with the one I already ordered? Could it be canceled or something since he never contacted me? I am also beginning to wonder if it would even be safe to send him a money order since he has not even responded to me yet. What do you suggest I do?
I haven&#039;t gotten his information from him and haven&#039;t sent the money order since I don&#039;t know where to send it.
We agreed before I bid that I could pay with a money order and now he is not responding to my emails telling me where to send it. Isn&#039;t there a certain time period that he has to tell me were to send it?
I don&#039;t have a paypal account and it won&#039;t give me his address when I click &quot;pay now&quot;
Also I know that he is active because he keeps adding items and yet he still doesn&#039;t respond to my emails
