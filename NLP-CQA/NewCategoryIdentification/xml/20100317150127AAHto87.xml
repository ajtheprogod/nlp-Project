    <ChosenAnswer>Anything from cars to full living room furniture, sports equipment, computers, or 1000 $1 items, If you are wanting to just spend money look and see what they offer that you want and make a bid and see what you can get. If it is a precise thing you need you can do word search to find it.
If you are selling then you need a credit card, bank card, or debit, prepaid card also works, set your account up, get a Pay Pal account, then get verified, this takes about 4 days. Sorry but you want to be sure people know you aren&#039;t just a bum that can&#039;t be trusted no do you?</ChosenAnswer>
