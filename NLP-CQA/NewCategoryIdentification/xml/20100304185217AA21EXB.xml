    <Subject>How long does it take to receive a payment to Paypal account when selling on Ebay?</Subject>
    <Content>Im selling an item on Ebay and I have a few bids on it already.This is my first time selling and I was wondering once the bidding winner wins and they pay thru Paypal will I get an email or what?Will the money show up in Paypal quickly or will it take business days to show up?Also when they pay everything is done automaticlly right,for example I dont have to give my email to the winning bidder?What are the exact steps,is there anything else I need to do?Sorry for asking so many questions.Thank you.

    <ChosenAnswer>When the item is sold, you will need to send the bidder a payment request as soon as you can, unless they&#039;ve already paid.  If they&#039;ve already sent the money to your PayPal e-mail address (remember to make sure you have the PayPal e-mail address registered with eBay otherwise they won&#039;t ba able to pay, and you&#039;ll have to inform the seller of the PP e-mail address) then PP will e-mail you and you&#039;ll need to accept the payment, which will be credited to your account then.  Once you&#039;ve received payment remember to inform the bidder when you&#039;ll be sending the item, and then e-mail them once you&#039;ve sent the item so they know it&#039;s on the way.

To withdraw money from the PP account it can take anything up to 10 working days to appear in your bank account.</ChosenAnswer>
