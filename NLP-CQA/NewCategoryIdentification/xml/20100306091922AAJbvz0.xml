    <Subject>Message board suggestion?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi all, 
I&#039;m trying to find a decent place to start a message board....
I&#039;ve checked out a bunch of sites, most of which are overly complicated and have poor features. 

I&#039;m wondering if anyone can recommend a forum/messageboard host which has the ability to edit a post without &quot;edited by&quot; appearing in the post somewhere...
And also post approval features, so you can check what added to your board before it becomes public viewing. 

I&#039;ve tried proboards, yuku, phpbb, forum motion and some others too but didn&#039;t find much joy. 
If anyone can help point me in the right direction I would be very grateful. 
Thanks all!

    <ChosenAnswer>I have used a few but I like http://www.forumotion.com the best its simple and easy to use

The best thing about Forumotion is that there is nothing to download and nothing to setup. You just have to choose a forum name and they&#039;ll do the rest. You can have a fully functioning forum up and running in less than 30 seconds.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>What I have used (though not been admin of) is google groups.  You may want to give that a try, or maybe yahoo groups.  I would recommend that the most if you are planning to use a message board with people that you know personally.</Content>

            <Content>As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your forum website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.

If youâ€™re going to create a forum site at your own domain without any forced ads, you need a web host providing forum tools (phpbb or vbulletin).

Take a look at:
http://www.threehosts.com/forum
There you can reach the three reputable companies that are leaders in the forum website hosting industry.

There you can find a video tutorial to learn how do it.</Content>
