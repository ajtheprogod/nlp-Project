    <ChosenAnswer>firefox is good for xp, it runs smooth. I liked it when I had it
IE is okay, but its not as good as it can be.
Google chrome I like as a browser it is fast, speed, very efficient.
Safari is heavy and bogs down the system especially with xp as I have had it before unless they have made it a faster browser</ChosenAnswer>
