    <ChosenAnswer>To save your bookmarks, open Firefox, go to Bookmarks &gt; Organize Bookmarks, click Import &amp; Backup &gt; Export HTML, navigate to location to save it, click Save. Once you&#039;ve re-installed Firefox, do the same process except select Import HTML

            <Content>Completely remove firefox, delete your firefox profile and start anew.

To find your Firefox profile folder, press the Windows + R shortcut keys to bring up the RUN dialog box. You can also type the command directly into the Start search menu (for Vista and Win 7 users only)

Type in this command:

%appdata%

and then hit enter.

In the folders that appear, find one that is labelled &quot;Mozilla&quot;, and delete all it&#039;s contents. (This forces Firefox to generate a new profile when it&#039;s installed again)

Once you&#039;ve done that, re-download Firefox (the latest version) and install it again.</Content>
