    <Subject>Formspring Question, Important!!?</Subject>
    <Content>If someone posts a link to their formspring account on their facebook, and I click on that link and ask them a question, do they know it&#039;s me if I don&#039;t have a formspring account?
That One Girl, THANK GOD, I asked some awkward questions that I&#039;m hoping were definitely anonymous.
