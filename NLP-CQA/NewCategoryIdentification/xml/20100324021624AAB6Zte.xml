  <Question id="20100324021624AAB6Zte" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why wont my Ebay photos upload right?</Subject>
    <Content>All my photos are lightened a little bit before being uploaded :)

-The photos just kept loading and never completed
-The photos loaded but then said they had an error
-The photo wasnt viewable, so I got the original one to upload as a test, it worked, then I flipped it the right way and it failed

Please, this is really frustrating!
Thanks so much xD
