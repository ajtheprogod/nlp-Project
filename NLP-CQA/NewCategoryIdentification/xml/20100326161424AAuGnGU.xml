    <Content>Computer virus help please?
I have been searching things in google like &quot;cut bread out of a vegan diet&quot; &quot;pancake recipe&quot; or &quot;maple sugar replacement&quot; and half the time it will say &quot;redirecting&quot; and it will go to places like &quot;info direct&quot; or &quot;my deal match&quot; which are other search engines. I am afraid to click them because of possible viruses. It also took me to a baby and parenting site, and a place to sell me a blender/food processor. o.o The page that has come up the most is the one that says &quot;Your computer has viruses, we need to scan it&quot; and it is a web page, not my virus scanner. I also scanned my computer with McAfree and it said I did not have any viruses. So do I have an undetected computer virus? Please and thank you for thee help ^^
