  <Question id="20100322144331AAt7eiZ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can someone explain what 4chan is?</Subject>
    <Content>I mean, I know it&#039;s a website where anyone can post comments about different topics for free, and that most of the people on there are anonymous.
But, what is /b/ and what is anon? I&#039;m asking here, because whenever I ask a 4chan website user, they call me a newfag and won&#039;t answer so...

also, I&#039;m to afraid to go to the 4chan site because someone might hack me. Is this rational?

    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s basically a forum site for adults.
/B/ is a random image board, and anon is short for a group called anonymous. I&#039;m not exactly sure what they are, but I think they are a group that strongly believes in Scientology. Here&#039;s their site:

I don&#039;t really get on 4chan, but I heard that anonymous is bad news from some x-users.
And I don&#039;t really think you should be scared to get on 4chan and be hacked, but the site is really kinda bad. It&#039;s filled with trolls and jerks.

I&#039;m sorry if my info wasn&#039;t very specific, I just looked that stuff up on google. :/</ChosenAnswer>
