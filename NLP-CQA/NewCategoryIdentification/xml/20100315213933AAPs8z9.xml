  <Question id="20100315213933AAPs8z9" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I become a better sh-t talker?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m tired of all these flamers online that want to pick a fight every opportunity they get. In chatrooms, in forums, pretty much anywhere where people gather to communicate, I see them. what frustrates me more is that I&#039;m horrible at coming up with comebacks. I&#039;m not a good smack talker. People tell me to just ignore them, but they get worse if I do, and I just can&#039;t stand them.

So how can I become a better sh-t talker so I can actually confront them and win? Help :(
