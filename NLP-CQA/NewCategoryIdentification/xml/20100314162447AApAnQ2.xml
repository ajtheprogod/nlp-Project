    <Subject>Sold an item on ebay and recieved payment. What next?</Subject>
    <Content>I am a newbie to selling. I have sold a box set dvd of a movie on ebay in an auction. I have recieved the payment but I have absolutley no idea of where to go from here.  What I thought was i would just post the item to the address with royal mail first class and be done with it. But there is stuff on paypal about tracking and postage labels. This is confusing for me???
