    <ChosenAnswer>B/c you can&#039;t sign in to multiple yahoo accounts on the same machine. That&#039;s b/c when you connect, you are on a secure connection to the network card on your machine. You can&#039;t have simultaneous secure connections to yahoo.

There are ways around this. You can create a virtual system on you PC and log in from that one. But that may be above and beyond what you want to do.

Or you can sign in from a different computer.</ChosenAnswer>
