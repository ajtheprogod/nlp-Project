    <ChosenAnswer>there is no search engine that can do that but you can search for a buddy by name or email if you press ctrl+s. 

also you can look at the recent people you IMed by click on a person&#039;s screename, then click on the little drop down arrow to see the recent sns you IMed or looked at a profile on.</ChosenAnswer>
