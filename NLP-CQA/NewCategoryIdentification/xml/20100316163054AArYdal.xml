    <ChosenAnswer>More soon means that they have to restock their prizes at the next redemption(one per month). They usually have redemption around the 3rd or 4th week.Guarunteed prize for___ ptz means that you pay PTZ to have the chance before anyone else to buy whatever you want according to the PTZ amount you paid for. It is legit, however, it may take a while for your prize to get delivered. If anyone wants a Lockerz account just send an e-mail to my profile.</ChosenAnswer>
