    <Subject>Term for when a web page&#039;s &quot;Comments&quot; section goes immediately off topic?</Subject>
    <Content>Is there a term for when a web page&#039;s &quot;Comments&quot; section goes immediately off topic, such as when the most frequent posters just chat with each other through the comments forum, or trade jokes? I don&#039;t just mean the occurrence of &quot;firsties&quot; posts, though they are usually there, too.

One place I noticed this was at the AV section of &quot;The Onion&quot;. I will read a recap/review of a TV show, or a review of a movie, and will have to skim through dozens of unrelated comments until I can actually get to some feedback that was written about the article.

For example, here is the review of &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;: http://www.avclub.com/articles/inglourious-basterds,31969/ . It isn&#039;t until the 23rd comment that someone actually gives their opinion about the review or the movie itself.

So is there a term for this? I wanted to see if any articles had been written about the phenomenon, but I don&#039;t know what term to use.
