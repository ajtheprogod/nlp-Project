    <Subject>how do i retrieve deleted comments on blogger?</Subject>
    <Content>Does anyone know how to recover comments deleted in Blogger / Blogspot comments by the blog owner?
I tried using Google or Yahoo! cache but they&#039;ve cached the newer versions of the blog posts with comments.
I&#039;m trying to find a comment I know was deleted on a blog I follow.
