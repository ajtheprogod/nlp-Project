    <ChosenAnswer>First click upload photo, like you usually would, then under the upload button it says: Did you know you can post photos from your phone? Just send your photos to.....

            <Content>Go to twitpic.com and then click &quot;upload&quot; which should be in the top right corner somewhere. It will have a number for you to send a picture message to and the picture will be twitpicked.</Content>
