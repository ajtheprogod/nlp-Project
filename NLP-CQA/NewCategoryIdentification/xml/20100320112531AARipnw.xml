    <Subject>Haven&#039;t received Lockerz T-Shirt yet?</Subject>
    <Content>I made it onto the Z-List on February 22 or 23 so it has almost been a month now and I still haven&#039;t received my t-shirt yet. A few days after I became a Z-lister, I got an email from support@lockerz.com titled &quot;Update your settings to receive your Z-List t-shirt&quot; but when I opened the email, it was just a picture of the Lockerz logo and nothing else. The next day, I got another email from Lockerz saying there was a typo in the first paragraph in the email sent the day before, which I found really weird since there weren&#039;t anything written in the first email. Anyway, I know Lockerz is a legit site but they do tend to have a lot of flaws and such. Yesterday (March 19) was the last day for people to make it onto the Z-List in order to receive a Lockerz t-shirt. Will I still receive mine? I live in Canada, if that matters.
I updated my settings a LONG time ago, even before I became a Z-Lister.
