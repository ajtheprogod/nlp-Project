    <ChosenAnswer>Be patient. I once sold 27 items to one person in one go, and they didn&#039;t leave feedback for 3 months. They had been on holiday lol

They may not have access to the internet for a while, or just forgot. Give it time, it&#039;s not the end of the world.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Feedback is NOT compulsory!  One of these days, when a seller keeps hassling me to leave feedback I shall put negative and the words ..... this is the feedback you MADE me leave.

Leave them alone.</Content>

            <Content>Surely it&#039;s their prerogative to just buy and leave. That&#039;s what happens in High Street shops or the classified ads in newspapers.</Content>

            <Content>Why are you getting frustrated, far too many people worry about feedback. Do you go into a shop and ask them to rate your transaction ?
Feedback is only relevant in ebay world, not the real one.</Content>

            <Content>You can not force anyone to leave you feedback. Contacting them all the time to do so would probably result in feedback that you do not want. I would leave it alone.</Content>

            <Content>Ebay feedback is a system designed to help others understand the trustworthyness of buyers/sellers. Feedback is a courtesy to others. Most people provide feedback. But it&#039;s not mandatory. If your buyer doesn&#039;t post feedback, forget about it and move on.</Content>
