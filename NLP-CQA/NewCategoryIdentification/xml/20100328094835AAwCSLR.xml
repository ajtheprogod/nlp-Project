    <Subject>Lockerz Help and Tutorial?</Subject>
    <Content>I found this around the internet and was really curious (free stuff! yay!). I was just wondering how I was to get started. And I know I need to get invited and all (also, if you can, can you invite me?), but what happens afterward? Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>Okay so basically after you sign up, you  can get ptz every day that you log in. there are also daily questions that you  answer for ptz. the best way to get ptz though is to watch videos. when you save up your ptz, you redeem them for awesome stuff such as xbox 360, ps3, macbook ect. Yah, I will send you an invite if your email is on your profile. If not, pick me as best answer and tell me your email in your response.</ChosenAnswer>
