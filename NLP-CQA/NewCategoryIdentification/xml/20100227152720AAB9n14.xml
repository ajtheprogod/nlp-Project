    <Subject>Is downloading a Windows torrent very dangerous?</Subject>
    <Content>I know the dangers of Viruses ect.
But legally is downloading Windows very risky?
One time I downloaded Windows XP, and then got a letter in the mail from my ISP, have me call, they said to remove it from my computer. That&#039;s it though.
Because I reallyyyy need to recover my computer&#039;s Windows Vista!

    <ChosenAnswer>That&#039;s a really bad idea.

It&#039;s one thing to illegally download an Atari 2600 game; you&#039;re unlikely to anger anybody by doing that (of course, you still shouldn&#039;t do it though). It&#039;s yet another thing to download something that&#039;s actually still commercially available *today*. Moreover, Windows is the most popular OS in the world, so that&#039;s a really bad choice of software to illegally download. 

You can actually walk into some stores and buy Windows Vista today. That&#039;s a really bad sign. You can&#039;t walk into a store and buy Windows 3.1. If you were asking about the safety of illegally downloading Windows 3.1, I would say that it&#039;s probably low (still inadvisable though, of course).</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Stay away from torrents. They are extremely dangerous. Anything that has to do with P2P is unsafe.</Content>

            <Content>Go get PeerBlock or PeerGuardian. Those will block your IP number so there will be less of a chance of you getting into trouble. If your ISP has to keep sending you emails or letters, then you might get your internet account suspended.</Content>
