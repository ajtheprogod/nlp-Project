    <ChosenAnswer>Supposebly, it&#039;s possible to trace it to a wireless cafe. They would find the local ip of the computer and have to trace it back to that cafe&#039;s ip. But, since everyone at the cafe is using the same ip, he would be able to blend in with everyone at the cyber cafe. They wouldn&#039;t be able to tell who was using the ip. He could easily use the cyber cafe&#039;s ip, and then book it before the police show up. No evidence.</ChosenAnswer>
