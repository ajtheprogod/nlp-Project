    <Subject>Question about AOL Instanst Messaging  (AIM)?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay so I just got a AIM account so i could instant message and use that email cause I really am not a huge fan of this one.  Problem is I can&#039;t figure out how to IM. I do this... Go to AIM.com, sign in, click mail (which by the way I have to use the basic version because if I use the standard version if just say loading the whole time! Is there a way to fix that?) that takes me to my email.  NO trouble there.  I can&#039;t figure out how to access IM though.  Where do I find it?  What do I click on?  Also is there a way to make my IM name different than my email?  SOrry if i confused you. I&#039;m really confused myself.  

If you can&#039;t make heads or tales of what I just said would you please just tell me everything you know about AIM mail and IM please.  Thanks so very muchy!!!!
Also are there smiley faces for the emails in the basic version

    <ChosenAnswer>You need to either download AOL Instant Messenger, install it, and log in with that, or log into AIM Express, which is basically the same thing except it&#039;s web-based. Links to both can be found here -&gt; http://products.aim.com/

With regard to your second question, I&#039;m pretty sure the free version has smileys. My sister has AOL for her mail, but I don&#039;t know for sure if she has the free version.</ChosenAnswer>
