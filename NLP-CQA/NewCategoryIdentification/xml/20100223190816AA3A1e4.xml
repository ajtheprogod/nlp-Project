    <Subject>Firefox addon for saving an image with a click?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m looking for a firefox addon that will let me save an image I click on with some form of modified click (like shift+click, or middle click, or something like that). It should then save to some pre-specified image directory automatically.

Is there an addon that does anything like this? I really hope I don&#039;t have to make this addon myself... but it sure would save me time.

Also, addons I&#039;m NOT interested in is ripping all the images from a site. I&#039;m looking to save only specific images just much much faster than rightclick-&gt;save image as...

    <ChosenAnswer>This is the closest I could find, you still have to right click and save image as, but this way you can put it directly in the folder you want.
