    <Subject>How do i submit my stories to deviantart?</Subject>
    <Content>I am currently making a story for a little (i guess here in america you would call it a &#039;cartoon&#039;) anime/manga thing. i wanted to send it in to deviantart because then i could send the chapter&#039;s corresponding cover pics as well. But it would seem im a noob at deviantart. how do i submit stories? (i need really good detail as i have almost no idea what to do here.)
