    <Subject>BT Unlimited Download not really unlimited?</Subject>
    <Content>I have BT internet option 3 (supposed to have unlimited downloads) which quotes on the website exactly this: 

This package comes with an unlimited download limit with a fair usage policy which may restrict the amount you can download via your internet connection. This package is suitable for medium usage; here are some helpful representations of downloading:
60 hours web surfing = 1.5GB
1 Music Album = 0.06GB
10 Min Video Clip on Youtube = 0.2GB
Low definition movie = 0.75GB
DVD quality movie = 4.5GB
10 hours of internet radio = 1.2GB

If there is really a limit to the downloads with this package, how can they get away with saying there isn&#039;t?

    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s a bit of an issue here. Yes it&#039;s unlimited however the FUP or Fair Use Policy means at anypoint in the cycle they can restrict the speed you download at thus making a so called 8Mb run at 56kb if you download more than the average.

They are not in legal breach of their contract you can still download as much &quot;wait for it!!&quot; as your line will allow not as much as you want.

To be honest I work in It and have always never had a problem and I do 60GB+ a month, however you do pay a premium for it.

I mean you you expect a sink tap to fill your outdoor olympic swimming pool without paying a premium?

I hear what your saying and in no way getting at you but the reality is OFCOM doesn&#039;t care and the average internet user fails to grasp the concept of (nothing is really free).

Always read the small print and prepare to pay a price for wanting to fill you&#039;re swimming pool each month LOL</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Your ISP (comcast, roarunner...) can restrict your bandwidth if you use a lot of it so they are protecting themselves from lawsuits</Content>
