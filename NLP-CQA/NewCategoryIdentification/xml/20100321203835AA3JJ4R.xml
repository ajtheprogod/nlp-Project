    <ChosenAnswer>I personally have a an account on my personal computer and didn&#039;t have to pay anything to play Second Life, although you are some what limited to the game from other produces that other players made and sell. These produces sold may have an advantage over free items. Also be aware of free produces because of spy equipment, other players may put them in the scripting and they can monitor you like spyware. But over all you can either pay your way though the game with a credit card, paypal, or (I assume as you said) from you cell number or play for free.</ChosenAnswer>
