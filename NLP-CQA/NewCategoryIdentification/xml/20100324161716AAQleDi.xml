    <Subject>Don&#039;t we use the internet because we don&#039;t want to see commercials?</Subject>
    <Content>now I see commercials, advertisements WITH SOUND, pop ups, google ads that you can&#039;t skip on youtube, and banner ads EVERYWHERE you look.

why are these everywhere? 

computers are supposed to be a step above television, now it is just as bad?
I don&#039;t want apps to block ads.

    <ChosenAnswer>Like television, radio and before that the telegraph - putting a web site on the Internet isn&#039;t free. Never was. Never will be. You might be able to put a few pages on the Internet on sites that don&#039;t charge YOU, but it&#039;s costing someone somewhere.

There are computers to run, and computers aren&#039;t free - nor the electricity and people to monitor and maintain those computers. The buildings housing the servers/people aren&#039;t free, either.

You&#039;re paying your Internet Service Provider to connect to the Internet with the computer you bought, with an operating system you paid for.

If you want something that&#039;s commercial free, I suggest you buy a book - for a nominal fee, of course!</ChosenAnswer>
