    <ChosenAnswer>actually ken, it&#039;s NOT a scam. they can afford to give out so many prizes because there is a LIMITED amount. they allow redemption&#039;s on a scheduled basis, and if you don&#039;t get to the prize before someone else, then too bad, your sunk, and you have to wait &#039;till next time. and it DOES work, and ya i was skeptical at first but at last redemption, i got a 16 gig iPod touch. and this next upcoming one, i aim to get Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. the way that lockerz makes its money is the polls that you answer daily. the polls you answer are tallied, and then sold to a company that can make use of the information. that&#039;s how they afford the prizes.

and to the question, sorry i don&#039;t know what your asking. i don&#039;t know of any... subscriptions. if you can explain a little more, that would be great.</ChosenAnswer>
