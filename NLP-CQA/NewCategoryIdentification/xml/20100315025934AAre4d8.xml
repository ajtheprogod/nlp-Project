    <ChosenAnswer>If you can see it so can they. If they are two separate sites, then your browser won&#039;t know that only you have permission to view the photo on photobucket.

On photobucket, private albums can&#039;t be viewed, but if they know the link then they can see the pic, so yeah you can still show images from a private album.</ChosenAnswer>
