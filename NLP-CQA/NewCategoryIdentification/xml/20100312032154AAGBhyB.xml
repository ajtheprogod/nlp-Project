    <ChosenAnswer>You can do this faster without SEO which is typically a long grueling process especially if your website is in a competitive market.

A quick and dirty way is youtube buying. Basically you find a popular video related to your site then contact the creator of the video and ask to have them put a link to your site in the description of the video. Of course you would offer to make a small donation for their trouble.

It really is one of the easiest and surefire ways to get targeted traffic to your site and fast.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The only way that is possible is with article submission - ezine, buzzle, goarticles, ect.

I now run a seo firm. I can tell you out of everything I&#039;ve learned, the most powerful traffic methods is article submission. This has ranks most of my website on the first page of google, and brought tons of targeted traffic.
