    <ChosenAnswer>Turn off your computer and then turn off your DSL Modem/Router. If you have a separate router turn it off too. Leave all the equipment off for about two minutes.

If you have a separate router from a DSL Modem/Router combination you should turn the stand alone router on first and wait a minute or two, then turn your DSL Modem on. After that you can turn your computer on and everything should be fine.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The signal quality is the connection between your computer and your wireless access point or router. It has nothing whatsoever to do with your Internet access. What kind of Internet access do you have? Is it DSL? Cable? Dialup? The problem is there, not with your wireless.</Content>
