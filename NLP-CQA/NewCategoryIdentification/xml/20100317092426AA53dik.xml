  <Question id="20100317092426AA53dik" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I want some info about starting a blog?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m thinking about starting a blog, it would kinda be about my life (as boring as it may be) and I was wondering if it&#039;s safe to post photos of me and my friends. I would also put my referral link for &quot;Swagbucks.com&quot; on there,how many swagbucks do you estimate i would get? Thanks in advance!

    <ChosenAnswer>I think it&#039;s save if you post pics, but remember that once it&#039;s on the internet... it&#039;s on there. People can use it and copy it etc. if they want to. So if you really want those pics to stay to yourself you shouldn&#039;t put it online... I would ask your friends if it&#039;s alright as well. 

Sorry I have no idea what Swagbucks is &gt;.&lt; But good luck with your blog!</ChosenAnswer>
