    <ChosenAnswer>You don&#039;t say what happens when you try to download something (e.g. by clicking on a download button or a link) but if nothing happens I would say it&#039;s most likely that you&#039;ve picked up a virus or IE has been corrupted in some way.

Go here and download the free version, run it and get it to automatically remove any virus:

If that doesn&#039;t help I would try re-installing IE. Obviously you&#039;ll have to download it from another computer and transfer it by burning a CD or poutting it on a USB stick or external drive.

Good luck.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Try resetting your browser back to default settings.

To do this, click on Tools &gt; Internet Options.

Click on the Advanced tab.

At the bottom of the Advanced tab you&#039;ll see a button called &quot;Reset&quot;.

Click on the button and it will reset the browser back to default settings. Afterwards, close the browser and open it again. Hopefully you&#039;ll have full access to your browser again.


If it still isn&#039;t working, you can open the browser is a special safe mode called &quot;No Addons Mode&quot;.

To do this, 

Start Menu &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Internet Explorer (No Addons)


If your browser works in No Addons mode then it means that something like a toolbar or an addon or plugin is preventing your browser from working properly. You can manage addons in your browser by click on the Tools menu &gt; Manage Addons.

You can enable/disable individual addons until you work out which one is causing your issue.</Content>
