            <Content>Yes, it is free. It is a way for people to communicate with you. Like, if you have haters, they will hate message you on there. And if you have friends, they will probably say funny things.

Hope this helps :)</Content>

            <Content>it&#039;s stupid and all you will get is hate-mail from people too pansy to tell things to your face and have to hide behind a computer screen...unless you really are too insecure to not get one, then you will probably get a few &quot;i think you&#039;re cute&quot; &#039;s or &quot;are you single?&quot; &#039;s</Content>
