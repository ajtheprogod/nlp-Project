    <ChosenAnswer>I also received this link in an e-mail and it didn&#039;t work.  I then keyed the address in and I did get to the web page (&quot;Care 2 Make A Difference&quot;) but when I clicked on &#039;Happy Easter&quot; I got the same HTTP 404 error - &quot;The page is unavailable or has been changed.&quot;  It doesn&#039;t really answer your question but at least you know others are also having problems with it.</ChosenAnswer>
