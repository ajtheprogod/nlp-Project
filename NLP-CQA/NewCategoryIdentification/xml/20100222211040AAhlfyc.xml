    <ChosenAnswer>it&#039;s quite entertaining.. i have to admit. it&#039;s going to cause depression though. cause internet people are mean :/ i&#039;ve seen really young kids on it too, which makes me a bit upset that their innocence is getting lost so young. i feel like there should be better security measures or something, but it&#039;s a wonderful concept overall, and i&#039;m hooked. i&#039;ve met some cool people on it, and it&#039;s a cool way to spend some free time.</ChosenAnswer>
