  <Question id="20100325201128AAaPEwH" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I can&#039;t download anything from the internet on my computer?</Subject>
    <Content>All of a sudden my computer will not let me download anything from firefox. I have always been able to do so. I click on a free download from the internet, and it brings up the download box, but nothing is downloading, and it doesn&#039;t leave me a link on my desktop to finish the download. What is wrong? I went into the security tab on firefox and typed in the website in the allow box under exceptions, but that didn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve also tried clearing the cache and everything, but still nothing. Please help me to get the download succesful? Any info will be helpful
