            <Content>That&#039;s a very good question! I&#039;d hazard a guess that it&#039;s because people feel they can get away with it. The internet takes away face-to-face, personal accountability for one&#039;s behavior; now you can be a jerk, change your username later, and no one&#039;s the wiser. But to not blame it all on the medium of the internet, some people are &quot;a55holes&quot; to begin with. Some people enjoy getting a rise out of people and that&#039;s the sole reason they post the way they do. Just ignore it and no attention for them! ^^</Content>
