  <Question id="20100320134616AAGSYfV" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Bleudame.com - safe and legit, or a scam?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m going to order some sunglasses from wwww.bleudame.com but the prices seem to be a little too good to be true.

Has anyone used their services before? Don&#039;t want to enter my card details into a dodgy website.

Thanks.

Although the Web site you are visiting is operated by an active Authorize.Net merchant, their Verified Merchant Seal is currently not configured properly. Please contact the merchant directly to confirm the authenticity of this site. 
so it looks like the site doesnt care about that.. which i would consider very important to show they comply with security.</ChosenAnswer>
