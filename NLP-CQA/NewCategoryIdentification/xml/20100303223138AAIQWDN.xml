  <Question id="20100303223138AAIQWDN" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Social site automatically uploading picture?</Subject>
    <Content>I just joined a new social network- Holypal- and it automatically uploaded a picture for me. 

It just so happened to be a picture of me and an old dog of mine, and I don&#039;t like to see pictures of him, it upsets me.

I looked at the profiles of other newcomers, who just have a plain avatar with no picture, as if they haven&#039;t added a pic yet. I didn&#039;t either, it chose one for me?

The picture doesn&#039;t even appear in &quot;my photos&quot;, and I have no idea how to delete it.

I find this bizare. How did the site pick a pic for me, but not for other people? 

Is this normal? Is this legal/aloud? What if it had picked an innappropriote picture for the internet? Isn&#039;t that a violation of privacy? Is this some kind of glitch/bug? How did this happen? 

Has this happened to anyone else before? 

I consulted the site, but who knows how long that could take...

I&#039;m extremely baffled...

    <ChosenAnswer>Maybe a friend of yours who uses the site had already uploaded it and the site automatically made it your profile pic since you didn&#039;t have one. Just a guess.</ChosenAnswer>
