    <Subject>My computer will not go to hotmail and will not work on other sites...?</Subject>
    <Content>I just bought an anti-virus for my computer because the old one ran out and now when I try to go to hotmail the page is completely blank! Also when I try to go on Pogo to try to play games it won&#039;t let me play. And when I get on myspace it won&#039;t let me see updates, accept comments, or anything! I also cannot veiw videos and some pictures and things on certain websites. The old anti-virus was uninstalled and I have adobe and everything that I should need. I have even called the anti-virus company several times and they have said they would fix it but they have yet to do so. Can anyone help????

            <Content>Try checking your Add-Ons.  Go to the IE &#039;Tools&#039; menu, click on &#039;Manage Add-Ons&#039;, then choose &#039;Toolbars and Extensions&#039;, and then choose &#039;Run Without Permission&#039; in the option box in the lower left corner.  You might see Windows Live Sign-In Control&#039; disabled.  Make sure it is enabled.  There are 3 &#039;Windows Live&#039; selections you may want to disable to stop the delay in opening Hotmail, but that&#039;s your choice.</Content>
