    <ChosenAnswer>It will most likely take over a month. You have to first earn all the points. And then Lockerz randomly has their redemption days once a month and they only last for about 30 seconds! It could take a few months

But just a suggestion is to try swagbucks. Swagbucks is very legit. Ive made over $100 in amazon.com gift cards. Its a search engine just like google, but you randomly win swagbucks every day for searching and entering swagcodes. Try it out-       http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</ChosenAnswer>
