    <Subject>Internet Explorer problems....?</Subject>
    <Content>I am currently running Windows XP on my PC.  A few months ago, I upgraded my Internet Explorer to IE 8.  I had previously been running IE 7 with no problems.  Recently, I have experienced difficulty getting on the internet.  When I click on my Internet Explorer icon, it will begin to download, and then the screen will revert back to my desktop.  Sometimes I have to click on the IE icon 5 different times before the internet will finally appear and be useable.  Other times, the download begins, but then the computer just crashes and I have to restart the computer and try again.  I&#039;ve downloaded Mozilla Firefox and don&#039;t have any trouble with that, but I&#039;m not thrilled with some of Mozilla&#039;s features and would rather have IE work properly.  Has anyone had any of these problems with IE 8, and, if so, how did you resolve them?  Did anyone delete IE 8 and then download IE 7 again?  Did this get rid of any problems?  Any help anyone could give me would certainly be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
