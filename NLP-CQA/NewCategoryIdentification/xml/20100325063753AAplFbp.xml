    <ChosenAnswer>Yes. All you have to do is get points by doing nothing really. You can get points for answering a poll, logging in, and watching videos. Then you can redeem them for prizes such as the iPod touch. If you want to join, message me your e-mail so that I can invite you to the site. (It is a member-only site at the moment).</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yes, but it takes so long! It&#039;s almost not worth it :(
Have you tried http://myhotprize.com? I got an watch from them (in about a week) and now I&#039;m earning points for electronic cigarettes, lol. It&#039;s also boring but it takes a little less time :)
