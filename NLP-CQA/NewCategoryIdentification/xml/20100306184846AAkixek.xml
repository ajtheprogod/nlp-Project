    <ChosenAnswer>if you want speed, google chrome is currently the fastest available browser, but being relatively new, it is not yet compatible with everything, but because it is gaining a sizable market share it will probably be included in the future.

http://www.google.com/chrome

Firefox is also very fast and is compatible with almost all applications, and it also has a large community meaning lots of plugins, support when you have problems, ect. 

http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html

Firefox is all around a substantial amount better than opera.

On my computer I use both Chrome and firefox, but i tend to use chrome more.</ChosenAnswer>
