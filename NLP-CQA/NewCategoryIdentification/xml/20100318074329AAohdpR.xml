    <ChosenAnswer>First go to My Ebay and check the item is in your Won list.

If it is then send a message to the seller asking what is happening and say you will wait 48 hours for a reply before starting a resolution report.

Then if you don&#039;t get a reply, go to the resolution center and begin the process.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>first, is it a large or small seller - a new or longtime seller - in general you will be better communication from longtime sellers. 

Also if they use delivery confirmation and do it via paypal, it should show up under your item where is says &quot;tracking number&quot; in your items won. 

Ebay now requires sellers to put in their terms the number of days handling - I would double check what that was - I always put 3 days, maybe they  put 5 or more?

also I just checked on an item I purchased on Saturday - it is coming from LA - a 100 mile drive - it has not arrived yet - I went and checked and the auction says:
&quot;Please allow up to 14 days for the FREE standard shipping service REGARDLESS your shipping address.&quot;

so I assume the free ship comes by pony - 

another issue - if its a BOOK, video game or movie or any thing that will go via media mail, it can take up to 2 weeks. 

you need to ask for the delivery confirmation - if they dont have one, say you dont have one and what happens if it doesnt arrive.</Content>
