    <Subject>I bid the wrong amount on ebay, and now it&#039;s too late to cancel it?</Subject>
    <Content>So I was bidding for some BKE jeans last night-it was going to be for 9.50, I check on my account at noon today and realize I had entered 950 instead. (!) The bid time ends in 3 hours and you can&#039;t retract a bid if it ends in less than 12-what can I do???
The price of the item is 9.50 though, so would i get it for the price or for my maximum bid?
okay good! i thought you automatically had to pay for it once you won

    <ChosenAnswer>Just contact the seller and explain the situation. I am sure they will understand that you did not mean to bid that amount for some jeans, and the seller can cancel the bid for you.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I think you would get it for the maximum bid, you can still withdraw you&#039;re bid, or if you win, just don&#039;t pay the person...obviously, go into your account and look around, there&#039;s a q &amp; a thing on ebay that should help</Content>
