  <Question id="20100312054822AAHJaM1" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Any other official Gorillaz Twitter accounts?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve been searching, but I don&#039;t know how to tell which ones are genuine and which ones are fake. The only one I&#039;m 100% sure about is Murdoc&#039;s &#039;MurdocGorillaz&#039; account, as this is what sparked a question in my mind: do any of the other band members have accounts? (Well, maybe not Noodle.)

I know it&#039;s a long shot asking here, but I don&#039;t know of any other way than to ask the perhaps well-informed fans of Gorillaz.

    <ChosenAnswer>Unfortunately I don&#039;t believe so. If you check the band&#039;s official page, it might give you updates if they get Twitters in the future.</ChosenAnswer>
