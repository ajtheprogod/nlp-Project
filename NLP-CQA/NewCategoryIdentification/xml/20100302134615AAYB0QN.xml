            <Content>Well, as a frequent user, all I can do is recommend Google Mail, I wouldn&#039;t really say it&#039;s fun, but it sure is good! You get built in G-Talk, Google&#039;s Chat Program. You also get a Twitter-like application called &#039;Buzz&#039;. I would say it is reasonably safe. Like you require, it is free and easy to use.

I suppose that really it could be fun, as they allow you to customize your Inbox with backgrounds and themes.

If you&#039;re interested, go ahead and try it: http://mail.google.com/</Content>
