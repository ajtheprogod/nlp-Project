    <Subject>Is it illegal to use other peoples routers to connect to the internet for free?</Subject>
    <Content>I have 2 of my own connection but when looking for my router i saw tons of other peoples routers. Is it illegal to connect to someones unprotected router? I heard it&#039;s legal if they&#039;re not protected. Also can someone fiddle with my routers settings if they tap off of it. I&#039;m thinking about securing it i just hate the password thing.

    <ChosenAnswer>Get your router secured right away.  You have to remember that whatever you&#039;re considering for your neighbor&#039;s unsecured network, they are probably considering about you.  Also, it takes away one problem for anyone who is trying to mess with your settings.  You shouldn&#039;t have to worry about the password; for most devices, you only have to tell it the password once.  Another thing: don&#039;t use WEP encryption.  It only takes about 5 minutes for somebody to crack it (with free online tools, too).  Use WPA or WPA2.</ChosenAnswer>
