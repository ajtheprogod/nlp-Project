    <ChosenAnswer>Power cycle your router. Unplug the power from the router and wait 2 mins. Plug it back in and wait 1 min. Reconnect computers. Mines does the same thing from time to time.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>This can happen because of too much trafficking through the router. Resetting the router is your best option. (On the back there should be a little hole with &quot;reset&quot; next to it. Press that and hold it down for 10 seconds.) If you don&#039;t already have a password on it, put one on. Some outsider might be accessing it. Hope you problem is solved!</Content>
