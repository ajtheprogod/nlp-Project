            <Content>rewards 1 is horrible ive been on the site for over 2 years and got nothing, points 2 shop is also horibel too i actually tried to order something and 2 hours later when i checked my account i had negative points and negative cash, so both those experinces were horrible. im on a better site now which is alot easier to get points. all you do are answer daily polls, you get points for logging in, you watch videos and get points for that, and when you invite firends you get points here watch this there will be an even better description. if your interested send me an email with your email address because the site is invite only you need an invite to register
