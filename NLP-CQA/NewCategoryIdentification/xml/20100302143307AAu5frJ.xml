  <Question id="20100302143307AAu5frJ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there a keyboard shortcut to have Firefox launch pop-ups in the background?</Subject>
    <Content>normally they immediately jump in front of whatever you&#039;re doing, which disrupts the browsing process. I&#039;d like them to launch, just underneath my current tab.
@Steven - They popup as a result of clicking on a link. I need the information from the popups, I just want them to open behind the tab i&#039;m working in, so I can open 10-12 popups in the background quickly, without having to minimise each tab after clicking each link.

    <ChosenAnswer>If pop-ups were avoidable like that and not disrupt your browsing they wouldn&#039;t really be popups. You could get a ad blocker, that will stop a lot from even happening, or chrome there is google chrome browser, that puts the popup in a tab.</ChosenAnswer>
