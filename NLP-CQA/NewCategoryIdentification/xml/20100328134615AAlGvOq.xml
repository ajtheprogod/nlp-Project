            <Content>Mine is used from my paypal account money first  and if there is not enough they take the rest from my card. If you don&#039;t want them to use the gifted money you transfer it 0ut to your bank account before you pay for anything else.</Content>

            <Content>After you&#039;ve bought something on eBay, and go to Paypal to pay, you&#039;ll be presented with whatever options you have to pay - from which bank account, directly from your Paypal account, etc. Just choose where you want the payment to come from.

Good luck!</Content>
