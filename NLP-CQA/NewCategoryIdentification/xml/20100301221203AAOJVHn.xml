    <Subject>At&amp;t Internet wireless router?</Subject>
    <Content>Well I&#039;m looking into changing my ISP to at&amp;t and I was wondering, They have a single port modem for single pc for $62, now the thing is im not well familiar with modems and routers etc, but I&#039;m guessing this modem isn&#039;t a wireless router right?...

So I would have to purchase a wireless router in order to use my laptops wifi? 

If so like how much would that cost?

Or does at&amp;t offer a wireless router also, because one of my friends has an at&amp;t wireless router but when I asked him how he got his service, he said that all he had to say was that he has more than 1 laptop that he wants to connect on they same network, is this true?....

Thanks to all in advanced.
