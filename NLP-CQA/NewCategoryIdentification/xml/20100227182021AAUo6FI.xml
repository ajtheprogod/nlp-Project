    <ChosenAnswer>My sister likes Blue Mountain greetings, a friend uses eeek-mail (it&#039;s all mice cards, and very cute) and I like Birthday Alarm.  I don&#039;t know the address for the eeek-mail one or Blue Mountain, but you can probably find them easily enough through your favorite search engine.  www.birthdayalarm.com is the one I use so I know that address.</ChosenAnswer>
