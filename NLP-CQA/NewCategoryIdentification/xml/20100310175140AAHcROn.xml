    <ChosenAnswer>Lockerz randomly has redemption days, never announced and they only last for 30secs. Tho it is possible.

I use swagbucks and have made over $100 in amazon.com gift cards! Prizes are always in stock. Its just like a google search engine but you win swagbucks for searches. Heres my link, and its not hacked.           http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You see, Lockerz isn&#039;t very that smart. They don&#039;t exactly tell you the date or time of the redemption. Its just in the hall, They say &quot;The Redemption is now!&quot;, but they never say the time or date before it. I recommend joining swagbucks because it is like lockerz, but you search and win points but with those points you can get free stuff, but the store is open 24/7 with great prizes. Here is my referral link (if you join under it, you earn 30 swagbucks for free!)
