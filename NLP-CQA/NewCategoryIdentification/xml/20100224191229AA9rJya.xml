  <Question id="20100224191229AA9rJya" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Are there free online storage sites that allow file sizes over 1GB?</Subject>
    <Content>I was going to upload some files to MSN SkyDrive, which has a 25GB limit.  Then I found out that each file must be under 50MB, so that won&#039;t work.  Are there any free sites that allow large file sizes?

Thanks!
