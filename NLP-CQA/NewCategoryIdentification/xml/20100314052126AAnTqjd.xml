    <ChosenAnswer>Server side scripting is &#039;broken&#039; .. I would guess the site you are visiting is &#039;under construction&#039; and the owner has left it in a non-working state .. 

By the look of it, the site code has been uploaded with &#039;absolute&#039; instead of &#039;relative&#039; path names .. (easy thing to do if you can&#039;t be bothered to pay for proper site maintenance)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It&#039;s because it cant find the file. Make sure the file exists in the relative path (so if D:\websites\ukwwwroot\classes\box.php) . If it fail, you can type the absolute path ( Like D:\websites\ukwwwroot\product.php )
Also, to verify the relative path, you can use the dir function in php to see if the path exists ( directory / and /classes )

Seeing the source can help me to help you ... !</Content>
