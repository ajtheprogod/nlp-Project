    <ChosenAnswer>I tried calopi.com and really liked it..you should give it a try if you want something new.

Its one the best i&#039;ve used...it has many features that might be of interest to you, like task management, todo lists, views (this one is really very useful), reports, sharing with friends and also a forum if you want more specific functionalities

last thing, there&#039;s quite a unique feature in the website called spot me which is like a google desktop/spotlight feature..its very helpful to find/open something quickly</ChosenAnswer>
