    <ChosenAnswer>Yes it is possible to connect two routers to your in home network. I don&#039;t think it will slow down your connection speed. Unless one router is rated a &quot;N&quot; router, and another is a &quot;G&quot;. That will be the main thing on the speed. Because &quot;N&quot; routers are faster than &quot;G&quot;. But it will not screw everything up with the phone line. Just follow this guide I posted it talks about how to do it, and whatnot.</ChosenAnswer>
