    <ChosenAnswer>Here&#039;s what you need to do:
1) Log on Skype
2) Go to Skype - Account
3) You get a pop-up page. In the bottom left corner you see your registered email. 
4) Click on email settings, proceed as instructed.

NB: if you do not know your password and have no access to your registered email address and have no purchase history you will have to create a new account, as customer support will have no means to verify your identity. But if you know your password, you can change your email address fairly easily.</ChosenAnswer>
