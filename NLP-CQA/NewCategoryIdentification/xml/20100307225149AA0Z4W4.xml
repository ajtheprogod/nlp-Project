    <ChosenAnswer>Short answer - you can&#039;t

BUT, use an RSS reader (like google reader) and it will save any you missed the previous days and allow you to view it there. 

The blog itself doesn&#039;t allow you to see previous days. Most likely because it&#039;s so popular they need to worry about their bandwidth they pay for - since they don&#039;t make money from adverts.</ChosenAnswer>
