  <Question id="20100302073720AAKl1uT" type="Answered">
    <Subject>how do people get your IM address?</Subject>
    <Content>If I get an IM from someone out of no where, does it mean they&#039;re probably just randomly sending out messages in hopes it&#039;ll reach someone?  Or does it mean they&#039;re a user here?

Bonus Question: what&#039;s a polite way to say Hey stupidhead, the name is Maria, so you and your wife will have to look further for a threesome w/ another guy.  Try emailing Bobs or Franks instead of Maria&#039;s.

            <Content>You question implies that you are using Yahoo! IM and I do not use due to the fact when I did all someone had to do is add @yahoo.com to your ID to IM you. However it has been a while since I used it and do not know if that is still the case. 

Moving on to you statement about the threesome. Reality is married couples have a plethora of choice when it comes to selecting males for a threesome. Single males interested in a threesome are a &#039;dime a dozen.&#039; Believing that you possess some special talent that they cannot get elsewhere may help your self-confidence but the reality is an invited male in a threesome is nothing more than a tool to increase the wife&#039;s pleasure. If you cannot graciously accept rejection then you will find that you will have a difficult time finding couples and that you will have a short-lived life span in the lifestyle. My advice is to accept the rejection and begin to understand what the invited male role is in a threesome.</Content>
