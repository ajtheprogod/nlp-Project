  <Question id="20100315122940AA2i2vV" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I get them to take this down?</Subject>
    <Content>I found out through Googling my name that I am on wink.com and they also have my maiden name posted which bothers me. I emailed them at feedback@wink.com and asked them to remove me but they don&#039;t. So how can I get them to take it down? I didn&#039;t give them permission to post it! O.o

I know it&#039;s what can happen when you&#039;re online but I would prefer if they took it down because that&#039;s my right. 

TY =)
