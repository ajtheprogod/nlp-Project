  <Question id="20100325004046AARpvsX" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is a good site to find people with little information?</Subject>
    <Content>I am trying to find someone but I have very little info about this person.  I have tried all the social networking sites, the free people search sites but have come up empty.  I&#039;m pretty sure she got married but I have no idea what her married name is.  I know the state and county she lived in and wondered if there was a site that I could go into that would give me information on residents of that county.  I don&#039;t mind paying for a site if it REALLY works.  Does anyone have any suggestions of where I could look?  Also, have you tried the site you are suggesting and what did you think of the site? Thx.
Yohan - I have already done this but thanks.
