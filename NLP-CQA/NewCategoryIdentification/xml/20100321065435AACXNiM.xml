    <ChosenAnswer>There is nothing you can do about it. What is transmitted is as is.

If it&#039;s crap quality to begin with then you will receive crap quality.

However if you are watching it with your nose about a foot from the screen then it will be slightly out of focus. 

A computer monitor screen isn&#039;t any different to a TV screen and if I remember correctly from way back it was recommended you divided the screen size by 4 and turned it into feet.

So if you are watching on a 20&quot; screen then you should be at least 5&#039; away from it.</ChosenAnswer>

They&#039;re not out of focus, that is just the quality of the video file, some are good quality and some are not.</Content>
