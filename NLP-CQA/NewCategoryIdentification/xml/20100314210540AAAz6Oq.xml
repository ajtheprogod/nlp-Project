            <Content>Learn html, css, xhtml, javascript, php, MySQL, etc. and you can make good web pages. If your just starting out, start learning html / xhtml and css, then move on to the other languages as you get comfortable with those.

            <Content>I may be able to help. For like 7.95/yr you can get a domain. Then you need hosting space to host the website which unfortunetly costs alot more. I and a friend own an unlimited space domain we pay for so if you want a temporary (semi-longterm till we decide not to pay for it anymore) place, I can add it to my account so you can have some of the unlimited hosting space, no strings attached.
If you are interested, email me at PCcloud9 at gmail dot com if your interested. Maybe we can even share info as I do the same thing in my area partime. I may make a second website for my stuff too.</Content>
