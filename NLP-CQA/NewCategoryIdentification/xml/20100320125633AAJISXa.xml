    <ChosenAnswer>Well, seems no one has answered your question about what happens to YOUR information once a site goes away...

1) A site can use YOUR information for whatever purpose they want. If they have a &quot;privacy policy,&quot; it usually says they can change the policy at any time without notice. So the policy can &quot;we&#039;ll never share anything with anyone&quot; on minute, and say &quot;Ya know, we&#039;ve decided to sell everything we know about you to the highest bidder, sorry about your luck&quot; the next.

2) No site is totally safe against theft. Someone hacks the site, any information you&#039;ve given the site may be in jeopardy. Happens all the time.

3) Why would you give strangers personal information? Do you teach your kids to walk up to strangers on the street and tell them where they live? NO! So why do YOU do it on the Internet???

Best of luck. It&#039;s a cold, cold World.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Well I just visited it... it says nothing about being unsafe. If it is, though... don&#039;t worry. Unless you gave them your email password, your safe.</Content>

            <Content>You get that message when you visit the site because someone reported that it may download spyware at connected PCs. I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s going to be taken down and, what is more, I just visited it and didn&#039;t find any problem. I hope it&#039;s been helpful.</Content>
