            <Content>Twitter and Facebook are basically the same.
All they are is reading peoples status.
This is the thing.
1 best is Myspace becasue it has everything from music,Customization,STATUS&#039;s,messeges, comments and so on.
2 best is Facebook,Its has messeging,statuses and funny fan pages.
3 best is Twitter it only has status&#039;s.</Content>
            <Reference>I have all 3.Myspace rapes facebook and twitter.</Reference>

            <Content>i agree with eric the only thing interesting is reading the celeb tweets, cus at least you can sit there and listen to their slightly more interesting lives. For the vast majority i don&#039;t see how tweeting is really that interesting as i don&#039;t really need to know if my friends are making cups of tea or just nip to the shop for a drink.

Stephen Fry&#039;s tweets are usually pretty insightfull.</Content>
