  <Question id="20100322120524AAccckX" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there a way around those &quot;complete a survey&quot; things?</Subject>
    <Content>So you go on a website and you&#039;re really excited to enjoy its content. Then a box pops up and says you can&#039;t view the page until you complete a survey.

All the surveys available require your cell phone number at the end.

Obviously, it&#039;s a trap and you&#039;ll end up getting loads of texts forever and paying the phone company a million dollars. 

But still, a lot of my favorite websites have this lock on them. Is there a way I can cheat this survey thing? I tried putting in fake phone numbers, but it knows they&#039;re not valid. I also tried putting in real phone numbers of celebrities etc, but it asks you to validate with a code that it sent the number you entered. 

Can I cheat around this?
