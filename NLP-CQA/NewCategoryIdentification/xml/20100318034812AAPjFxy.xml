  <Question id="20100318034812AAPjFxy" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Internet connection error help?</Subject>
    <Content>My laptop&#039;s browser suddenly stopped working, so I assumed someone just bumped into the wires again. But even after about 10 minutes I still couldn&#039;t browse. I checked and on the lower right corner there was an exclamation point on the wifi bar. The next day I found out that somehow my torrent finished downloading even with the browser unable to load. Does someone know how to fix this problem? I found out that this happens every few weeks, it somehow gets fixed automatically in a few days but I want to know if there&#039;s a way to fix it myself.

    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;m guessing you&#039;ve already restarted your pc, so try waiting a few minutes after you turn on your computer and close down processes you may have running like torrent downloader, instant messaging, and the like.

Also, sometimes when your internet says it is down and the browser isn&#039;t working, your torrent can sometimes still download because your computer has a direct link to the internet, which is strange, but it happened to me when I was on instant messaging once.

If the little exclamation point shows up, right click and press troubleshoot problems, or whatever it is on your pc.</ChosenAnswer>
