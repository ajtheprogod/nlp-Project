  <Question id="20100222231818AAzYLx6" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I need a new browser that has very simple/easily workable bookmarks; are there any?</Subject>
    <Content>I was using Flock, but when I upgraded, I was horrified to discover that I simply cannot even use their new bookmark system. I already tried Firefox, and it&#039;s very similar to Flock.
