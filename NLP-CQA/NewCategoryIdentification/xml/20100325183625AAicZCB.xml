  <Question id="20100325183625AAicZCB" type="Answered">
    <Subject>On the site myYearbook, can you appear offline? If so, how do you make yourself appear offline?</Subject>
    <Content>There are some days when I want to check my account but not want to chat with anyone. So I was wondering if there was an &quot;Appear Offline&quot; feature. If there is, PLEASE tell me how to appear offline! Also, if you have an account for myYearbook, add me! Because most of the time, except for a few random days, I will be open to anyone who wants to chat!

    <ChosenAnswer>If you want to appear offline on the IM feature you can log off of IM while being on the site. On the homepage towards the right you will see IM off or on. Just turn it OFF when you don&#039;t want to be online however your account will still show as being online.</ChosenAnswer>
