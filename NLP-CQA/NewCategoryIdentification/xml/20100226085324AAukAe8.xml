  <Question id="20100226085324AAukAe8" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I installed Java update &amp; Adobe Flash Player update &amp; now I can&#039;t see videos on YouTube using either browser?</Subject>
    <Content>YouTube says I need to turn on JavaScript or install new version of Flash Player.  I have the latest version of the Flash Player installed and JavaScript is on &quot;on&quot; the Firefox browser.  When I tried viewing a Youtube video using Internet Explorer, it just shows me a black box where the video should play and simply doesn&#039;t play.

I&#039;ve also cleared the recent History on my Firefox Browser.  

Should I turn Comodo Firewall off?  Would that help?
Should I delete the last updates somehow?  (Java &amp; Adobe Flash Player)

Everything seemed to be working fine until I installed the Java update but that could just be a coincidence. 

Any help would greatly be appreciated...
Would using System Restore to go to a previous date correct this?
Restarting or rebooting didn&#039;t help anything...
