    <ChosenAnswer>I think so, I had to switch ISP because they throttled my entire connection down just because I was torrenting Ubuntu 9.04 and Openoffice.

With the &quot;high speed intenter&quot; I was getting, DAIL-UP internet would be faster even with the vuze off.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I don&#039;t even understand the term net neutrality.  I don&#039;t see how the net is biased.  If the government starts giving us internet for free (after nice pretty taxes of course) or better internet infrastructure, then they&#039;ll just control how much they want to charge us in taxes.  Obviously, that&#039;s if they don&#039;t bankrupt us first.</Content>
