  <Question id="20100304140650AADpLhP" type="Answered">
    <Subject>My roommate watches movies online and it slows down my internet to almost like dial up?</Subject>
    <Content>It&#039;s getting really annoying, he has never leaves the room and literally just watches movies all day. I can hardly get anything to load when hes watching movies, but when hes off it runs perfectly fine again, what should I do?
Well, I don&#039;t want to be mean because he really doesn&#039;t have many friends (if any) and goes home on the weekends, so its all he has to do share the router of course. And dimitri or whatever, if you were smart enough to get into college you would see it&#039;s annoying.

    <ChosenAnswer>Streaming movies takes up lots of bandwidth. If talking to him doesn&#039;t work, either get faster internet or a new roommate. (I imagine one is less expensive than the other.)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Bandwidth war. Its the only answer and its highly recommended by tech support.
You need to start using alot of bandwidth, Get a few downloads of ubuntu going and use all available bandwidth so he wont be able to watch movies. Eventually he will get the idea.</Content>

            <Content>Registry problems cause pc slow down.
Registry Cleaner can fix your pc errors.
Clean windows registry can speed up the computer.
Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software&#039;s, install new devices, 
download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system.
This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. 
Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.
Clean registry make pc faster.
