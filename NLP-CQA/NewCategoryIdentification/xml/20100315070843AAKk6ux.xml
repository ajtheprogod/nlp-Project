        <Answer>
            <Content>Depends on your skills and what you can offer over the internet.  Money is never free; it always costs you something. The internet isn&#039;t a cash machine and finding a legitimate online job is unlikely.  You&#039;ll probably get scammed quickly if you think it&#039;s a path to easy money.</Content>
