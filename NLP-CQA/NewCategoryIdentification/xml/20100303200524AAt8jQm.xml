            <Content>any time before selecting the name of the blog you should be really careful as the name of the blog should be such that the URL contains maximum numbers of the targeted keywords. This will help your blog grow in popularity faster. By targeted keywords I mean to say as your  blog is based on the life improvement, the exact competition for the keyword is 44,400,000, would you like to fight from these many people to get your blog up I don&#039;t think so that is feasible enough go to the Google keyword tool and find the alternative keyword which means the same, and the keyword you select should be such that people use in daily conversation, and the competition is also lesser, then the chances are that the blog will become popular faster.</Content>
