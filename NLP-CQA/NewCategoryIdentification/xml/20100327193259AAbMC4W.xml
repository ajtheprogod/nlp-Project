    <ChosenAnswer>Dear Big Juan,

Use Twitter and Facebook to start your online marketing for your forum. Learn Twitter first, then Facebook.

Use your common sense in inviting friends. You are looking for people who have your forum topic on their minds. Do searches in Twitter and Facebook to find those who are into it. 

This should keep you busy for at least two weeks learning and setting up those venues. Start 

slow with the invites. Google will shut you down if you are inviting too many people per day.

Twitter: Do not follow more than 10% over the number of people who follow you. 

Facebook: Take it easy here, too. Also, when you invite, be sure to give each person a message: 

&quot;Hi, Josh, I see you are interested in &quot;your topic&quot;. So am I. Let&#039;s connect.&quot; Later, Juan.

On both venues, do 15-20 minutes per day of inviting.

I have much more to share if you need more than this. I believe if you want to reply to me, you 

can reply here on this site. I will then answer you back and we may want to exchange contact 

information.


I learned these techniques through my team of mentors, who encourage me to help others.

Let&#039;s talk soon,
