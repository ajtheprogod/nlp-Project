  <Question id="20100307200938AABod9Q" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Story doesn&#039;t want to upload in Fanfiction?</Subject>
    <Content>Well, I recently uploaded a story yesterday and today when I checked in the search engine of the website it didn&#039;t show up. I put in the full title and some keywords but this - &quot;No result found matching your keyword(s)/phrase. Please expand your search.&quot; - just kept showing.

Anyone know what might be wrong?

PS: The weird thing is, it DOES show up in my page but not in the actual search.

    <ChosenAnswer>Hello,

It takes a while for it to show up in the search function just like if you&#039;re uploading a video to YouTube, they need to process it and in a few hours you should be able to search for it and find it; if not than I suggest you contact them for support as they will be able to help you more than we&#039;re able to.
