    <Subject>About sign in to the waves  I signed up for at lockerz Member Appreciation Redemption?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi, I&#039;m a Little confused

When they say that I need to sign in to each wave I signed up to what does that mean?

Does it mean that I just need to log in to lockerz at the time of the redemption and then log in to PTZ place?

Or is it something else?
