    <Subject>The sound on the internet keeps going quiet and muffled for a few seconds at a time?</Subject>
    <Content>The sound on the internet keeps going quiet and muffled for a few seconds at a time before returning to normal only for it to start again within 10 seconds. I&#039;ve been on multiple websites and it happens every time with music, video, ETC.. Anyone know why this is happening or what I can do to prevent it?

Thanks.

    <ChosenAnswer>Sounds like the video/music could be buffering which may mean its still loading, can you pause the video/music wait for it to fully load.  Some sites have a different coloured bar that loads across to show how much of the media has loaded, does it still jump after trying that?</ChosenAnswer>
