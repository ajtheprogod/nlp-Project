    <ChosenAnswer>Swavi.org is indeed a hack site. Its a site that is trying to steal your youtube account by you having to enter your user name and password. A hacker send you emails to a tinyurl site that goes to swavi,org. When the hacker has your account, they spam your account and upload porn videos. Whatever you do, do not go to that website.

            <Content>It&#039;s basically porn that hacks your account on Youtube and spams videos and links to itself. I don&#039;t know if it does anything for other sites, but be careful opening a shortened URL.</Content>
