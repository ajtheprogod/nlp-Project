    <Subject>Why does my Firefox keep crashing -__- ?</Subject>
    <Content>It keeps freezing and then it says:

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

It happens like every five-ten minutes. It&#039;s reaaaaally annoying me now. How can I stop this?
I just had a chocolate chip cookie a couple hours ago! :D And I always delete cookies and history. =/
