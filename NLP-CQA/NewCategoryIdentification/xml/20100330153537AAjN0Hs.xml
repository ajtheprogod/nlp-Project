            <Content>ha the EXACT same thing happened last night, it&#039;s a scam
1. look through files and stuff and delete anything from security tool (if you cant find any it doesn&#039;t matter really)
2. restart your computer and try to run it in safe mode(F8) 
3.if you got security tool pop-ups when you log back on open task manager (ctrl+shift+esc) or (ctrl+alt+delete) try holding them down and clicking &#039;end task&#039; like crazy
4. if that worked pop-ups should be temporarily stopped and its safe to remove
5. now you can start you stopzilla thingy, system restore, or go under control panel&#039;s add/remove thingy, find it &amp; remove it


:P stayed up till 5am trying to figure it out

this should temporarily hold it 2gether but i suggest getting an anti virus program in the near future
if yur internet explorer doesn&#039;t work you should use google chrome instead for a while

i also had this on a different computer and my mom made me leave it off for a few weeks(of course i snuck back on a million times a day since i learned it was a virus only last nite, but it eventually left, i dont think recommend that

also try to avoid clicking on the popups that can make it worse, just pull up the task manager

hope i helped, Viel Gl√ºck!</Content>
