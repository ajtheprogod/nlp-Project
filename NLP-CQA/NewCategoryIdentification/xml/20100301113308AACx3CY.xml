    <Subject>Creative&amp;Cute title for my fashion blog?</Subject>
    <Content>I live in Hungary and my name is Regina. I want my blog title ( ...../blogspot.com) to be really creative and cute. I like this blog&#039;s title : www.theblondesalad.com
As i was thinking about a name i realized that my blog is going to be a mix/salad about my life, because it is going to be about fashion, beauty, my life, and everything else i like. I would love to have the &quot;salad&quot; word in my blog title. 

Thanks for helping me :)

    <ChosenAnswer>My first thought was &quot;Regina&#039;s Rack&quot; but I&#039;d suspect that wouldn&#039;t get you the user base you&#039;re looking for.</ChosenAnswer>
