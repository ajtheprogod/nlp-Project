    <Content>I was browsing youtube today and aw that one of the videos being watched was about 4chan being mentioned on jeopardy. ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7BiaTz_6gI )

I had heard of 4chan before but it was always bad things. If it got onto jeopardy it cant be that bad, is it safe to go there?
