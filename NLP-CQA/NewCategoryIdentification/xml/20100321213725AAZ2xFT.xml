    <ChosenAnswer>You can&#039;t delete them. Click on their icon, which should lead you to their tumblr profile. Wait until the page is fully loaded, and then you should see 2 gray, rectangular buttons. One should say &#039;unfollow&#039; and the other &#039;dashboard&#039;. Click the &#039;unfollow&#039; button. After you click it, the button will change to &#039;follow&#039;. Click on dashboard to go home, and the staff blog should be gone.</ChosenAnswer>
