    <ChosenAnswer>Nope, it&#039;s just like a regular skype call. 
The quality is generally a little worse than you would expect from a handset or landline phone, as you are talking to a laptop and all. Then again, it does depend on how good your built in mic is. 

But they do have a reputation for being notoriously bad. 
If you were planning on using Skype to make a lot of landline calls, I&#039;d recommend picking up a good headset, just so people can hear you better.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Reference>I do a lot of Skype, I&#039;ve almost phased out having a cell phone! 
It&#039;s great. No expiry on skype credit, beats pay as you go. Just need internet everywhere!</Reference>
