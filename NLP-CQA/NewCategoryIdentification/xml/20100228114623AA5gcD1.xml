    <Subject>Firefox default Search Engine help?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok, so I&#039;m hoping here that some of the tech-savvy people out there can help with this one, because god knows I&#039;ve tried as hard as I can

Recently, I download this stupid piece of software (I can&#039;t even remember the name of it anymore) and while I was installing it, I changed the default search engine for Firefox. Now, when I say the default search engine, I mean when you type something into the address bar and a search comes up matching the words from Google. After installing this software, It&#039;s been changed to some &quot;Freecause&quot; crap, and it bugs the hell outta me because it never turns up anything useful, whereas I can count on google to give me a decent result. 

So basicly,  Does anyone know how to change the search engine that&#039;s used when you type something into the address bar in Firefox? I&#039;d use the search bar at the side, but I&#039;m used to using to address bar..

Thanks A LOT for any help in advance :)
Thank you so much Will that worked like a charm, If I ever meet you in the real world, i&#039;m going to give you a million dollars!
Or whichever currency you&#039;re using :P
