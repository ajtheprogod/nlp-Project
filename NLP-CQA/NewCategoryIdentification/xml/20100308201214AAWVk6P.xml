    <ChosenAnswer>It takes a lot of time and patience especially with the redemptions. I have gotten a macbook from them but it took 1month for them to ship it to me, but I still got it in perfect working condition.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If you are very lucky... To the second... to the millisecond on your 20 bar dial up connection, you may be lucky enough to get it the second they restock, and instantly sell out...

Or you can pay 7000 points to reserve one. Yay! But that will take you a long time. Not worth it.</Content>

            <Content>Well, I won&#039;t recommend any other site but from what I&#039;ve heard and read on blogs, forums and their facebook wall, no one is able to get a prize on time, prizes are gone within few seconds.</Content>

            <Content>I just wanted to point out the contradiction in your statement HNK. If no one is getting a prize, then how can all the prizes &quot;be gone&quot;. Clearly they&#039;re giving out prizes. It&#039;s just that there is a very high ratio of people that want prizes vs. actual prizes. I&#039;m willing to bet the average user has no chance of getting a prize. The only people that actually get prizes are people that refresh the whole day of the redemption or use some kind of bot to auto-refresh and auto-fill the redemption information. So these people get all the prizes. If you&#039;re not in this group you&#039;re not getting a prize.</Content>
