  <Question id="20100326100947AAhDxsd" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does this sound suspicious or am I paranoid?</Subject>
    <Content>Ive recently started using ebay for buying and selling. Ive only been on for a week so Im still learning the ropes.
Ive got someone bidding on 3 of my items.
The buyer has been a registered user since 2007, but has 0% per cent feedback and no bid history(except 4 mine).
Someone else(with perfect feedback) has placed a bid on them, and the other person is the lead bidder atm.
Im getting paranoid and thinking that maybe the original bidder has changed his mind and used a fake profile to outbid himself, so as to avoid buying, and avoid negative feedback on his proper account.
Am I just thinking too much?...or could I be right.
Any opinions welcome x

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi there I have over 500 feedback and in my experience I would LET the O feedback Bid, But contact him/her for a valid home address number to verify him, also if he wins but doesn&#039;t win you will have to open a unpaid item strike and thencan send a second offer to the &#039;perfect feedback&#039; ebayer.

about the last paragraph you are worrying yourself too much

            <Content>It is my understanding that ebay would require a paypal account ect. to register an account. As such, it would mean that the individual has several paypals or had the foresight to create another ebay in 2007, which is highly unlikely, though plausible. Most likely you are paranoid.</Content>
