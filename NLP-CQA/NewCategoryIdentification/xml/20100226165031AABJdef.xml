  <Question id="20100226165031AABJdef" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Anyone good at finding stuff on the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>I ordered something from a chinese website. Things aren&#039;t going very smoothly. Anyways, after sending my item AGAIN, they gave me this second tracking number and after two days it&#039;s still showing up as &quot;No information available&quot;. Obviously the company I purchased from is saying the information is not yet up to date and to check regularly. This is the website : http://www.ems.com.cn/english-main.jsp 

It looks shoddy to me. Anyways, I don&#039;t believe these assholes anymore and I want to reach the EMS Courier company to figure out what&#039;s happening before I file a paypal claim. Nothing besides a 5 digit number only reachable from china is in their contact info. Anyone any good at searching and finding stuff :))) It would be very helpful to have their email! Thanks!
