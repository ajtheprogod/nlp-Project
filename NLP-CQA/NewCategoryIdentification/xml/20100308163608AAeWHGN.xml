  <Question id="20100308163608AAeWHGN" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do you PERMANENTLY delete your IE Address Bar?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay, so it&#039;s getting really full and I want to delete it!

I can delete my address bar history, but when whenever I look at the past websites I&#039;ve visited by pressing on the arrow, they all show up, so OBVIOUSLY something hasn&#039;t been deleted and I don&#039;t know how to delete it!!!!

Anyways, I hope you can help ;) Btw, don&#039;t say to just delete my browsing history because it DOES NOT work ... Remember, I&#039;m using IE

Thanks!! :P
