  <Question id="20100223215434AAcK8Mw" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Cha Cha account deactivation?</Subject>
    <Content>Your ChaCha account has been deactivated for 3 days for Guide Agreement Violation. This is due to violations of the guide agreement and was specifically highlighted in the KnowledgeBase under ChaCha&#039;s Infraction &amp; Response Chart. Your account is under research and payment will be made within the next 45-60 days for outstanding balance less fraudulent searches.



Can someone please tell me what this means? If you have ever used cha cha?

    <ChosenAnswer>Yeah they sent that to me once before too..then they sent me a notice a few hours later saying my account was activated again..lame. I hate ChaCha. I did it for maybe 3 days before I wanted to blow my brains out. Have you received the &quot;what can I use around the house to masturbate with?&quot; question yet? Sometimes the expediter answers are even worse than the questions....ChaCha lets their &quot;employees&quot; get away with murder. I went to KGB...Its much harder to get into ( you actually have to be somewhat intelligent) and they don&#039;t let you get away with anything..yeah...that was annoying so i quit that too. Good luck and don&#039;t worry im sure ChaCha will re-activate your account, its all just for appearances ...they really don&#039;t give a fuck.</ChosenAnswer>
