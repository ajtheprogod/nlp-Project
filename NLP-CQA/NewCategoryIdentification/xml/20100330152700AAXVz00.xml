    <Content>Virus...everything is infected???!?
Ok, so I was just on my internet browser and all of a sudden everything on my computer just stalls. Then after i reset my comp this &quot;virus suite&quot; program is scanning my computer even though I have never had this program ever before. Now for some reason whenever I attempt to open any program none of them seem to work and theres a info bubble that comes over this &quot;virus suite&quot; program saying that &quot;this application cannot be executed because that specific program is infected&quot;. The other odd part about this is that mozilla still works. If anyone has any experience with this virus, or tips on how I can get around this horrible computer disease it would be greatly appreciated. Luckily I have this macbook which I know I can trust in...
