    <Subject>I want to make a .net for a music band....?</Subject>
    <Content>There is a new band up and coming and I want to buy a .net domain with their name.  Is this going to be ok.  I see they have just trademarked their band name.  

Britneyspears.com is from Britney&#039;s people... but look at Britneyspears.net  is that just a random person?

    <ChosenAnswer>If they&#039;ve trademarked their name, then they do have the right to demand that you give the domain name to them, especially since you will be registering the domain after they trademarked their name. 

If they are an up and coming band, and you are already a fan I&#039;d say they won&#039;t care if you have the .net domain of their name. It will help promote them and they&#039;ll be grateful to you for supporting them in their early days.

You have to remember too, that if they decide that you&#039;ve infringed on their trademark it will cost them time and money to take you to court. Unless you are creating negative publicity, it probably isn&#039;t going to be worth it for them to shut you down.

If you are concerned, I think the best move would be to contact them before you register the domain and ask them if it is ok if you use the domain, and let them know what the site you make will be like.

Now, I&#039;m not a lawyer, so please don&#039;t rely solely on my information, but as far as I know what I&#039;ve said is generally accepted as how these things work.</ChosenAnswer>
