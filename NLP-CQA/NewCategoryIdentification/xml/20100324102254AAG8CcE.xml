  <Question id="20100324102254AAG8CcE" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What&#039;s the best browser?</Subject>
    <Content>This is moreover for reference than anything but what is everyone&#039;s favorite browser to use and why? I have never had any sort of luck with browsers at all. I&#039;m not a fan of IE, Netscape always locked up and crashed so I got rid of that and got Firefox (which I know is basically the same) and it&#039;s starting to act up in the same exact way too. I need something that&#039;s reliable and doesn&#039;t do stupid stuff like lock up for NO reason!

    <ChosenAnswer>This question is a personal preference, meaning you will get different answers out of everyone.

But Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari are all great, speedy browsers.  The only one that sucks massively that I would be sure to stay away from is Internet Explorer.

But give the other 4 a test.  You might find one of them fits you better than one of the others.

Opera is my personal preference.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>i would suggest you to go with Mozilla Firefox because its great interface and speed. I feel it’s a great alternative for IE. It’s fast, secure, and fully customizable. There are thousands of Firefox addons there which allow you to customize your browser according to your needs. For more information see http://forums.techarena.in/polls-voting/1205582.htm</Content>

            <Content>Firefox is the best browser.  You need to discover why it is locking up.  Check that you have the correct Firefox with your operating system and then run EST.com to see if your system is infected.</Content>

            <Content>All I can say is, I was an avid user and supporter of firefox.

until I heard about Opera 10.51

I was blown away. I was gonna just &quot;trial&quot; it and go back to ff most likely. but it turned out that I NEVER looked back.

Give yourself a week of customising it to ur liking and getting used to the AWESOME features that come with it and if you don&#039;t like it then, I give you my sincerest apologies.

It makes me wonder why more people don&#039;t use this browser.

It has been independently proven many many times to be THE FASTEST browser on earth. Plus, it is more reliable AND secure than Chrome. I really don&#039;t see how anyone can choose anything else. If they like the &quot;look&quot; of chrome, opera comes stock standard looking like it. I prefer the look of firefox so i simply checked a few boxes in preferences and voila.
