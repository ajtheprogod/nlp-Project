  <Question id="20100223144659AAJSycm" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I CAN&#039;T LOG INTO MY GAIA ACCOUNT!! HALP!!!?</Subject>
    <Content>So, I went to log into my account &amp; I entered my username &amp; password. It wouldn&#039;t let me in. I did this 7 or more times with my correct password (I put it in exactly correct for them all). So I sent a forgot password thing &amp; when I got into my email, &amp; clicked the link to change the password &amp; it said &quot;Invalid Key!
You are trying to change other user&#039;s password? Nice try!&quot;

WTF IS WRONG?! I&#039;m trying to log into my own account!!!

So I went to search for my avatar to see if I&#039;ve been hacked but it said &quot;The new forum search is a limited release beta. Please try again later when the feature is released ;).&quot;

Is that why I can&#039;t log in? (Stupid question. &gt;.&lt;)
Please help people!!!!! T^T

If it matters, I&#039;m Waffles of Darkness. xP
Thank you!
Yeah, that&#039;s me.

Your profile is still there but that doesnt mean much. Maybe the site is under maintenance.

Sorry but i had forgotten that even banned accounts remain online.
However if you were banned i think youd get a message telling you so.
This sounds like an error to me.</ChosenAnswer>
