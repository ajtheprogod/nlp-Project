  <Question id="20100308111947AAmOpQk" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Where can I download Alkaline Trio&#039;s self-titled album free without signing up?</Subject>
    <Content>I used to have the album, but I lost it and I didn&#039;t get to import it to my new computer. I intend to buy it again, but right now I&#039;m a poor college student (lol) and I can&#039;t afford it at the moment. I just REALLY need it right now. I&#039;ve exhausted every source I know and I can&#039;t find it. I tried getting the songs individually but all I can find are Goodbye Forever, My Friend Peter, and Cooking Wine. If you know where I can get the rest of the songs, too, that would be fine. Just no torrents and only -.zip and -.mp3 extensions; -.wma and -.rar don&#039;t work on my computer. Please, please, please, please, please help me!
Nah, shit...really?! Dude, I CAN&#039;T BUY IT RIGHT NOW. If you&#039;re not going to give me an answer I can use, DON&#039;T F*CKING ANSWER! It&#039;s a waste of my time.
