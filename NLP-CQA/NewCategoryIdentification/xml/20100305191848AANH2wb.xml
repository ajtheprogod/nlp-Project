  <Question id="20100305191848AANH2wb" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why don&#039;t Swagbucks award me when the people who I referred get Swagbucks?</Subject>
    <Content>I referred my friend and each time he earns Swagbucks, I don&#039;t earn any.  He has not reached the limit of 1,000 Swagbucks, so I don&#039;t know why it doesn&#039;t work.

            <Content>Make sure he correctly used your sign up link...

Mine is... http://bit.ly/aFTrpV

It can take up too 24 hours to get the swagbucks deposited to your account.
If it still does not work for you.. Sign up with my link and start again.
Or try sending SwagBucks an email and ask them too fix it.</Content>
