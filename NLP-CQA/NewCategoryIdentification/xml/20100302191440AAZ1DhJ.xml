    <Subject>Why doesn&#039;t the internet work on one specific page?</Subject>
    <Content>So, today I was using the internet and was going to go to this website. At first, it worked. But, then it had this one error. And, it says that it has been resolved and to just close the browser. I did but it was still having problems. So why does it do this?
