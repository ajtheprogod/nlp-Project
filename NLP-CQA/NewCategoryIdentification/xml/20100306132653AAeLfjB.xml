  <Question id="20100306132653AAeLfjB" type="Answered">
    <Subject>PayPal Student account?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a couple questions about the PayPal Student Account. 1 What if I need to get the money to real money, Will I have to transfer it to my parents account and then they have to transfer it to there bank account and withdraw it there? 2, How do I get the debit card thing? They mail it? 3, When I turn 18 can I make it into a full PayPal account? And 3, Other people can transfer money into it right?
Thank you
I looked everywhere on the site for the Student Account and can&#039;t find answer to my question. And if you know the damn answers why don&#039;t you just answer them idiot?

    <ChosenAnswer>All of these questions can (and should) be answered by your checking the FAQs page on PayPal.  I have recently read most of it.  It does cover these things.  Please get your information straight from the correct source in this case.  These are facts you are wanting.  Please read them yourself.  Get your parents to read them, too.  It&#039;s best that all of you know this.</ChosenAnswer>
