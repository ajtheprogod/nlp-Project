    <Subject>Why do I always have to refresh my web pages for updated page?</Subject>
    <Content>I have Windows Vista and lately I have to clik on refresh to get the updated page. Even in Ebay I have to refresh old pages whether I log on using favorites or use the web bar. Even when i reboot, I log into yahoo and have to refresh the page every time. I don&#039;t remember changing any configuration.

    <ChosenAnswer>i think that your browser is set to cache web pages, you can set the browser to always load the page from scratch. i think that browsers are set to load cached pages to speed up browsing, so if you have already been to a web page it does not have to load all the files again every time. most sites are only updated every few days anyway, so it would normally not effect you.</ChosenAnswer>
