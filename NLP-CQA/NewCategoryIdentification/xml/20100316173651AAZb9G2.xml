  <Question id="20100316173651AAZb9G2" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is My Website Name Professional?</Subject>
    <Content>I asked you guys about a name and whether it was childish, you guys said YES!

My name is Esmi, and the blog/website is about health, style, DIY, and life tips.

So would my name EsmiGercia . com be professional?

My readers would most likely be young women, what do you think?
