    <Subject>Can&#039;t save pictures in Firefox 3?</Subject>
    <Content>I right click, save as, and it seems like it saved, but it won&#039;t save to any folder.  If I drag it onto my desktop it will work, though.  Also, I&#039;ve tried deleting downloads.sqlite, and it doesn&#039;t help.  Can someone please help?
