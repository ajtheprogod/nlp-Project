    <Subject>What is the best blogging website?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m planning on going on foerign exchange soon, and want to keep a blog to keep my friends and family updated on my seemingly new life. I&#039;m not GREAT with HTML, but I have a general idea of how to use it, and I would like to have at least a little liberty with the background. A blogging site where I could upload pictures of my new experiences would be really cool too! Thanks. :)

            <Content>As Darshi has suggested, Google&#039;s blogger.com is best suited for your needs. It&#039;s a pretty versatile blogging platform. The url format of your new blog will be xyz.blogspot.com, where xyz represents your name. But if you want to make the url look xyz.com, blogger allows you to do that as well. You can tweak the looks of your blog, from 1 percent to 100 percent and add many functionalities to it as well.
For the time being you just create a new blogger blog and get started. All the best for your blogging journey ahead.</Content>
