  <Question id="20100321141214AAmC7MC" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Loads of eBay watchers, no bidders?</Subject>
    <Content>There are a few hours left on my item, and I have about 8 watchers but no one has bidded yet. I&#039;m just worried that they will all snipe the auction, and then the person with the highest snipe bid will win and it will still go for a low price. I know it&#039;s against the policies, but should I shill bid just to get a war going?

    <ChosenAnswer>Sometimes people watch your item with no intention on bidding, it could be other sellers watching to see what your item sells for or you will have people like me who will bid with 5 seconds to go   Also you can have 20 watchers &amp; noone will bid or 5 watchers &amp; get several bids. Really the amount of watchers you have is not important. Most experienced ebayers will bid in the final stages.

I dont recommend shill bidding, if ebay finds out you may have both your ebay accounts cancelled/suspended. What will you do if win the bid on your own item?

Either have a reserve or set the start price for the least you are prepared to accept for the item.</ChosenAnswer>
