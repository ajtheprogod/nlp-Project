  <Question id="20100225122002AAYptHh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is a website that lets people list their unwanted gift cards for sale a good idea?</Subject>
    <Content>I want to know if this idea could make me a lot of money.  To make money on the site, I would charge the seller a small fee once the card was sold on the site.  I would also put advertisements up on the site and a subscriber newsletter that could promote affiliate products.  If you don&#039;t think this online marketplace for gift cards idea is any good, please tell me how to make A LOT of money online and some of the best online business ideas to try out that could be profitable.

    <ChosenAnswer>Actually, it&#039;s not really a bad idea. You could also add an exchange option, in case two people wanted to swap cards.

As for online business ideas to make A LOT of money, you just thought of one. There&#039;s no pile of ideas just sitting there waiting. Most inline web businesses are come-ons and scams.</ChosenAnswer>
