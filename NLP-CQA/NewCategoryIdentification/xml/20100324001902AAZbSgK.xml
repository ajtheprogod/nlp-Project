    <ChosenAnswer>It doesn&#039;t matter to them cause they are making money anyways.... they do it by Advertisement and it&#039;s something that is never gonna stop making money. I don&#039;t hate it cause they so greedy. They can let it be sold pirated stuff but they won&#039;t low down their prices so that a lot more people can afford it and the results would be the same. It doesn&#039;t cost them nothing but they rise their prices to the sky that  a common man can never afford so the only way is to download pirated stuuf. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything. 

I&#039;m a small time film-maker and one I&#039;m gonna make it big. But, still I say they should do something wth their rates...</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>&quot; If you fucked up, it&#039;s your own bloody fault &quot; Don&#039;t blame it on the &quot; internet &quot; because if you expect to be safe on the internet than cancel you net and sell your computer. ( Not at  you of course, just my view )</Content>

            <Content>It says PIRACY you idiots not privacy. My opinion, do it at your own risk, but people stop paying for applications and software, then companies will have no motivation to improve or develop new stuff, leaving us further behind than we have to be.

As for movies and music, I have mixed feelings.</Content>
