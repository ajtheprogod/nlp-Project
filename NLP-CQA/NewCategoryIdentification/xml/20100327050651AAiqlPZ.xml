    <ChosenAnswer>Depending on where you live, you have several options.
A Cable provider: Cox, Comcast, or similar
A Fiber provider: Verizon.
And Satellite: Dish, or DirecTV had satellite internet options, (don&#039;t know if they still do)

I use Verizon FIOS in Fairfax.  Speeds 15 down/ 5 up, spending $50/month.
Prices change all the time, so can&#039;t tell you about the other services.
Always look for startup promotions.</ChosenAnswer>
