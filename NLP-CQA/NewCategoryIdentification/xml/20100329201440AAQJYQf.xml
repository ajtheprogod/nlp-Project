    <Subject>What&#039;s wrong with rapidshare?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay so I have problems w/ RS and MU. I&#039;m downloading two 200 mb files from rapidshare and megaupload (simultaneously) and I noticed the speed isn&#039;t quite right.

My ISP is comcast and the speed is supposedly 20 megabits/second (megabits, not megabytes). Regularly when I download from RS and MU and HF the speed is around 200 kbs/second to 400 kbs/second...I guess because they cap the download speed for free downloads.

Well, today it&#039;s around 60 kbs/second to 100 kbs/second! It&#039;s never reached that low.
