    <ChosenAnswer>I don&#039;t think so. I wish they did though, right? Because people ask me questions like Jessi, I love youu. And they wont say who they are, but it should say their email at least to ask a question so you have an idea of who is asking you inappropriate questions. And people need to realize that formsping is&#039;nt a website were you can talk shiz about that person and make them feel bad, and they don&#039;t know who is saying that about them, it&#039;s the worst feeling ever. Some one called me ugly on it and i cryed for 2 days straight, and realizing that anyone in my school could of said it; even by best friend. Be sure not to say bad stuff about anyone on formspring, because you dont want to be a bully. and if on april ools day; i they do reveal who said it and your name pops up, you could loose your friends forever. so becareful on there. Bye. Sincerly, Jessi</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Supposedly they are revealing all the anonymous user questions on April Fools Day.
I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there was a certain code to figure out yourself though, the website seems pretty amateur.</Content>

            <Content>You can kinda have a rough estimate of who asked you by the way they type online, but this won&#039;t always be accurate though.</Content>
