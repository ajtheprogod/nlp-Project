    <Subject>myminilife.com doesn&#039;t work for me...?</Subject>
    <Content>whenever I go to myminilife.com this message comes up:
&quot;You are seeing this page because the current domain is not configured in the current set of name servers or your domain is being parked. This is usually just a temporary error while the domain is being added. Once the domain is configured this page will expire and your correct site will be shown. 

If your system administrator is having you use the wrong resolving name servers you will want to notify them of this mistake right away.
If you are looking for free resolving name servers (for desktop and personal computers) we suggest you use the free service at Resolving Name Server.&quot;

It use to always work.. can someone help me fix this ??

            <Content>Unfortunaly theres nothing that you can do...........apart from one thing.........well first let me tell you whats wrong with the site. the webmaster has a dns server to keep the site running. this stores all of the website informaiton. this website cant do anything because theres a problem with the dns server.
so the dns server could have
broke down
have a virus
no power

there is one thing you can do though.... try to contact the webmaster(the company/person who own the site.</Content>
