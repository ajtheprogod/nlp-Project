    <ChosenAnswer>Air Force Blues.  I like it because I&#039;m in the Air Force and there&#039;s a lot of inside jokes.  Also, it has a very well developed plot / storyline, and it has a long history.  Since it&#039;s online I can read it for free and look up archived strips anywhere in the world.</ChosenAnswer>
