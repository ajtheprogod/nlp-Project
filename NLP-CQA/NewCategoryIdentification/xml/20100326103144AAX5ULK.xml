    <ChosenAnswer>You can get a virus from any site, even if your not downloading anything, as sites do get hijacked etc. So just because you are not downloading, doesn&#039;t mean you wont get viruses, sites do get hijacked frequently, so always be aware.

But, when downloading files you are increasing your chances, especially when you are downloading from others uploads.

If you are going to download files, just make sure you have a good Internet Protection software, I really recommend McAfee Total Protection.</ChosenAnswer>
