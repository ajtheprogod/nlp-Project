    <ChosenAnswer>You can&#039;t just simply &quot;transfer&quot; everything. But, you can copy and paste. Just copy everything you had from your Eblogger acount, and paste it on your dashboard for Tumblr. If it&#039;s not working, which it should, just make a new tumblr account. And start brand new. Everything should be there once you copy it. But, Like I said, No, you cannot &quot;transfer&quot; your account. Once you decide to make a Tumblr account, be sure to add me page! Theres a link at the bottom. I give advice anytime:)</ChosenAnswer>
