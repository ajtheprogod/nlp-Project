    <ChosenAnswer>All I can say is, I was an avid user and supporter of firefox.

until I heard about Opera 10.51

I was blown away. I was gonna just &quot;trial&quot; it and go back to ff most likely. but it turned out that I NEVER looked back.

Give yourself a week of customising it to ur liking and getting used to the AWESOME features that come with it and if you don&#039;t like it then, I give you my sincerest apologies.

It makes me wonder why more people don&#039;t use this browser.

It has been independently proven many many times to be THE FASTEST browser on earth. Plus, it is more reliable AND secure than Chrome. I really don&#039;t see how anyone can choose anything else. If they like the &quot;look&quot; of chrome, opera comes stock standard looking like it. I prefer the look of firefox so i simply checked a few boxes in preferences and voila.

            <Content>Opera, I&#039;ve always been a big fan of it and it&#039;s innovating features. It&#039;s also pretty secure, and different enough from IE, Chrome, and FF.

Chrome would be choice number 2.</Content>
