  <Question id="20100401151852AAhGfch" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What happened to OKCupid today?</Subject>
    <Content>When I logged in, it was fine at first, but then a notice pop out and said my computer has viruses and needs scanning. It looked very suspicious so I closed that tab. Then I was viewing a profile, and IE suggest me to leave the site because it is reported as unsecure! I used it for a long time and things like that never happened before.
Anyone has any idea what happened to it? Don&#039;t seem like a April 1st joke to me...

    <ChosenAnswer>Its happened to me several times before on this site - apparently its the adverts they use which cause these popups.  I went to the site about half an hour ago and got a popup that said I had a virus and it needed to do a scan.  I didnt touch it and just restarted the computer and all seems fine.  Made the mistake last time of clicking the cancel button - it loaded all sorts of rubbish on the computer and I ended up having to reformat the entire thing!

Its a shame as i like the site, but as I say this has now happened a few times over the last few months</ChosenAnswer>
