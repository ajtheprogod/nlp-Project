            <Content>You just practically update your friends on what you`re doing. It`s popular because you`ll know what other people/celebrities are doing. So yeah.</Content>

            <Content>because people feel special when they know things about others. seriously. that&#039;s really all it is. 
it is kinda funny how many people actually believe they&#039;re following celebrities around through it, though  :)  
unfortunately, facebook is implementing the same device, so everyone is stuck with reading about their friend&#039;s colonoscopy because they have to tell everyone about it from their &amp;*$% cell phone. 
...and somehow through a sociological phenomenon twitter is popular for this.</Content>
