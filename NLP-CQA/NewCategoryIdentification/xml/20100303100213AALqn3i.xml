    <ChosenAnswer>They put in a higher initial bid.  Simple as that.

Example: your first bid is $5.  Theirs is $100, but it only outbids you up to $6.  So you bid $10 - their bid automatically goes to $11.  You bid $20,  their bid jumps to $21, etc.  So just put the absolute maximum you&#039;re willing to pay, and it&#039;ll automatically top any lower bid submitted.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You were outbid because the person before you bid a high amount on that particular item, for that exact reason.  So he/ she ensure (or hope) that with their bid they win that item.  Reserve prices can only be set by the seller.</Content>
