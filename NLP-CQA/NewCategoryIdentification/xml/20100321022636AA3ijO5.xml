            <Content>Yes, open up your IE 8, go to Favorites, click &quot;Add to Favorites&quot;. You will then see the option to Export or import Favorites. Choose export and send to a USB Flash Drive.It will copy all your favorites. Then use the USB to import from the USB to your new laptop.

The steps are the same, just use import to copy from your USB.

If you do not have a USB Flash Drive, then just make a note to where you copied the Bookmarks to and then email it to yourself.

Good Luck and Happy and Safe Computing</Content>
