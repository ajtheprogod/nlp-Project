  <Question id="20100317220116AAZB3Zp" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I paid with PayPal but my order is still processing?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve used PayPal before and I have my check card linked so the payments are instant...to avoid the 3-5 day pending/processing time. In the past (on Ebay and other sites, even out of the United States online) the payment has gone through instantly with no problems. Tonight I placed an order on a UK site and paid with PayPal but the payment hasn&#039;t gone through. On my PayPal page it says the transaction is complete but on the UK site my order status says &quot;PayPal processing...&quot;. I paid almost 4 hours ago. 

What does this mean and why hasn&#039;t the money gone through yet? And is there anything I should do? Thanks in advance. **10 POINTS FOR THE MOST HELPFUL ANSWER**

    <ChosenAnswer>I have experienced this with UK sites before.
Some sites can take up to 2 days to process an order. 
This may be because an employee has to actually check the Paypal payment has gone through, which could take time if it&#039;s the middle of the night there or they have a lot of orders to process.
Give it a few days, and if there is still no change, contact the site about your order. Remember to include evidence of your order.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It can take some time.  As long as the Paypal says it has processed, you&#039;re good.</Content>
