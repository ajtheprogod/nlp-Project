  <Question id="20100311150438AAyUvfh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is LucidDeals.com a reliable site to get an IPOD TOUCH?</Subject>
    <Content>They sell an 8gb for like $50 when its normally $200! But you have to do ONE offer it says, they arent bad offers, I mean if paying $10 for gamefly for one month can save me $140 then its definately worth it. But Idk, will it scam me, is there strings attached? Watsup, 10pts btw

    <ChosenAnswer>i found this on another site regarding Luciddeals itouch offer:

This is definately a scam but somebody is lying. Lucid Deals would not complete the checkout after i had completed the CreditReport.com order, one of the services offered and required to get the &quot;good deal,&quot; got a confirmation, user id and password. I called CreditReport.com, They deny having anything to do with Lucid Deals and say that their link was stolen. But they cannot answer the question: &quot;Why would anyone send customers to Credit Report.com if they have no connection and get nothing in return.?&quot;  Stinks.

Would love to hear from someone who actually got the deal offered by Lucid.</ChosenAnswer>
