            <Content>it is a waste of time... !
but with some friends it might be fun, I acutally chat with some random people that were in my city ! that was fun, but, for real, there are some weird, i mean, really weird people who masturbates and let you see them...... thats less fun, yet suprising......

anyway, try it for fun, but i&#039;m sure you wont make it an habit.......!</Content>

            <Content>I tried it and it was fun! The only bad side is that you don&#039;t have enough control over what you will find! I had more fun with Facebuzz.com mostly because they have a porn filter! For the rest, it&#039;s the same only a bit faster! You should try it!!</Content>
