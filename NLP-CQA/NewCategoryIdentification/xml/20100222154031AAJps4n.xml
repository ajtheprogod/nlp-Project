  <Question id="20100222154031AAJps4n" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Where is the Paypal Plus credit card login?</Subject>
    <Content>I used to access my account from the Paypal Plus/GE Money website. Now when you go to this website it redirects you to Paypal.com. When I log in there is no sign of my credit card statement or activity. Paypal&#039;s &quot;Help&quot; section says you should go to Account Overview and click on See Statement Activity. There is no link that says that. Paypal&#039;s entire site is nothing but a mess! I just want to know where to go to log into my CC account. Has anyone else had this problem? Thank you!

    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;m having the same issue! I&#039;ve been on the line with them for a while and no one seems to have a resolution. My best solution would be to pay off the remaining balance through the phone and cancel the card.</ChosenAnswer>
