            <Content>One way is to advertise it on other websites. However, this costs money.
I know people ask others at forums to check out their website (but make sure you know the forum rules), which is often free and easy. Another way is to notify another website similar in field about yours. If successful, you could get an article about your new website on theirs, possibly attracting their readers to visit consistently.</Content>
