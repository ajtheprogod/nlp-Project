    <Subject>Computer virus&#039;s but very complicated stuff lol. any help appreciated!!?</Subject>
    <Content>i went onto a game website and all of a sudden, my security centre popped up saying that my firewall and everything had been turned off. then it said i had about 33 harmful spyware or virus&#039;s on my laptop. so i clicked &#039;remove&#039; after the scan only for it to tell me i wasn&#039;t subscribed to the program? and i have no money to pay for it!? so i tried to download some anti virus software but whenever i try to download anything, it won&#039;t let me. i try going onto my control panel and it just says &#039;application not found&#039; it also says this for my iTunes, Limewire, Windows live messenger and my word documents. i have no idea how to just wipe everything off it and start again because i have no disk for it? confused.com?
