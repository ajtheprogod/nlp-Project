    <ChosenAnswer>I cant get on either, its really frustrating. I hope its only down for maintenance, I&#039;ve also heard that chatango was shutting down. This really upset me and I heard there was a different site to replace it but I don&#039;t remember what the name is. Sorry. As a fellow chatangoer I hope it is up again soon. See you there ^.^</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I&#039;ve heard that they&#039;re moving, too. I think it was Chattanga.com. I&#039;m not sure if they have moved now or will some other time. Though, I&#039;m kinda anxious about it all, now.</Content>
