    <ChosenAnswer>Okay this can be caused by many things , Maybe the norton firewall is blocking some pictures , and maybe also your windows 7 security is too high , so its blocking some pictures as well. make sure you check both , usually this is caused because of a firewall , either the windows itself , or the antivirus software or the router firewall. So check them and if they are too high , set them moderate and try again to view pictures.</ChosenAnswer>
