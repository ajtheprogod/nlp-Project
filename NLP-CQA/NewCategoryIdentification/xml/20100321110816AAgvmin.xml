    <Subject>Name ideas for a PTC site?</Subject>
    <Content>I am opening up a &#039;Pay To Click&#039; site that will be much better than other PTC sites. It&#039;ll have lower-priced advertising and users will be able to earn more money per click. I&#039;ve got the money to set it up, and I&#039;ve got the software to set it up, now all I need is a name that sounds serious and will bring users in.
