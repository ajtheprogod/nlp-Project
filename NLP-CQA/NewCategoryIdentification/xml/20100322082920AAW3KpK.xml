    <ChosenAnswer>Cruise is right, though your prize could be delayed by the backlog of prize claims accumulated over the weekend. PR employees do not answer claims until Monday morning EST, and I&#039;ve noticed the claims taking longer recently (possibly due to increased popularity). You&#039;ll receive the card in one or two weeks once the claim is accepted. 

Steam game claims are usually answered quickly, and I made one on Thursday. I&#039;ll give you a heads up (in an edit) if it credits. That should give you a rough idea of when you&#039;ll be answered. Good luck! Kudos for sticking with PR longer than 99% of my referrals. ^_^

            <Content>It depends on what kind of prize you ordered.

If it was from Ebay, it would have probably told you when it would arrive.

Other than that it takes 7-14 business days.</Content>

            <Content>It&#039;s free. You have to pay the $89.95 shipping and handling charge first, preferably by sending them a check made out to &#039;cash&#039;.</Content>
