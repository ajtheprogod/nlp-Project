  <Question id="20100312072210AAJv9C2" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How to join partial files manually, downloaded by Internet Download Manager.?</Subject>
    <Content>I use IDM to download files form the internet, IDM usually downloads these files in a temporary folder, and in small parts. When downloaded, idm joins them to make the complete original file.
Sometimes idm gets disconnected, or the file(s) doesn&#039;t support resume and on disconnection i am unable to get the desired file, because idm doesn&#039;t join the partial downloaded parts.
These partial files are of type FILE. 
My question is, how can i join these incomplete parts. Is there a software out there that i can use?
Some times, these files are apart of a movie (AVI) then i can play he first FILE part in VLC Media Player, but the other parts don&#039;t play. How can i join them.
A big thanks in advance..........

    <ChosenAnswer>Open a command prompt window
Type the following command:

copy /b file1 + file2 joinedfile

(replace file1, file2, and joinedfile with real file names)

this will merge file1 and file2 (to a file named joinedfile in this case)
You can then merge the other files to the joined file to get another joined file. You get the idea.</ChosenAnswer>
