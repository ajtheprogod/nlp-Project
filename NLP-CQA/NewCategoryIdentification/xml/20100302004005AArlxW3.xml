    <ChosenAnswer>You can check the completed listings for similiar items sold for the last 15 days by going to Advanced search &gt; Enter your keyword ie Xbox 360 60gb console &gt; Tick the completed listings box &gt; search, this will give you a good indication of what price this has sold for. Repeat search for all your items.
I sold Tom Clancys rainbox 6 the end of last year (it was a PS3 game though), it sold for $15.50 AU - High sell rate ranging in price from $10 to $25 at the time. You can get lucky.</ChosenAnswer>
