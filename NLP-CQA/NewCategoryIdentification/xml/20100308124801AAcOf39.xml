    <Subject>A question about Amazon, help please :)...?</Subject>
    <Content>Hey everyone :)

I have an Amazon account, and you know when you order something, and it arrives, and you order another thing, and that arrives, and so on. And there&#039;s a &#039;Your Orders&#039; list that is created and records what you&#039;ve bought/has been received, and it builds up more as you go along and keep buying. Do any of you know how to delete that list? Or can that not happen??

Thank you if you answer! :D
To MK:
Yes, lol :P

            <Content>As far as I know you cannot delete your past order information, it&#039;s there for security and information purposes just incase you experience any problems or ever need to return anything. Are you wanting to delete your order history for privacy purposes?

Edit - in that case, there&#039;s nothing much you can do except keep your account details to yourself. ;) Try disabling cookies and password remembering for the amazon website?</Content>
