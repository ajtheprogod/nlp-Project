  <Question id="20100326034137AA1zQo3" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I made my first website, what do you think of it?</Subject>
    <Content>kuzzi.lifeyo.com

Please give me some pointers on what I could do to make this website more appealing to people. The subjects that it will cover are: humor, philosophy, games, anime, programming, engineering, and more. I am building it purely to provide entertainment for people with interests similar to mine. 

Also, as a 2nd (bonus) question, what could I do to spread the word about the site?

    <ChosenAnswer>I really like your site. I would recomend you to put a title at the top of each page above the navigation that says Kuzzy or whatever the name of your website is. Other than that, it&#039;s really cool.

Ideas for getting the word around:
- Submit your site to a bunch of search engines. Just search &quot;submit site to [search engine&#039;s name]&quot; and after that your site will be higher up on the page if someone searches something relating to your site. Try Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask.com, etc.
- Put a link to your site at the bottom of all your emails, letters, etc.
- Start a chain mail message advertising your website and encourage all your friends to send it to as many people as they can.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The term &quot;bonus question&quot; is normally used in a radio or TV quiz where participants are winning money or prizes by answering questions correctly - the bonus question, often optional, gives the contestant the chance to double his current winnings</Content>

            <Content>I like the design, just not a big fan of the hit counter, that&#039;s out of fashion now. 

Spreading the word: put the url into forum profiles, email signatures, submit it to google for indexing, submit it to review sites, add good content (something fresh rather than iterating what&#039;s already out there) and pray :)</Content>
