    <Subject>Any Good Ideas For An IMVU Avatar Name?</Subject>
    <Content>My current name is XxDisentrancedxX, and I&#039;ve had this acount since September of 08&#039; and have never changed my name since. But I&#039;m wanting to. I just can&#039;t think of anything great. I want something that sounds cool, and is me. So far I&#039;ve been able to come up with &quot;Thallium&quot;, &quot;Philophobia&quot; and &quot;Autophobia&quot;. But some things that happed to me today changed my mind. So I was thinking something with one of these 3 words, &quot;Shattered&quot;, &quot;Twisted&quot; or &quot;Tragic&quot;.. Any ideas? I&#039;d appreciate the help ^-^
