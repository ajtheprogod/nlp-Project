    <ChosenAnswer>Try these:

■ Follow too many people......You&#039;ll get 40% return as your follower........Then shorten your follower list.

■ Use a background that reflects you in your twitter page.

■ Follow celebrities....Send them twitter too often, you&#039;ll get at least 5 reply.....Retweet this and spread the news to your friend circle

■ Follow your friend and ask them to follow you also.

■ Don&#039;t irritate your followers and share quality tweets ( Don&#039;t share tweets in every 10 minute, make your tweets someone thinks worthy).

■ Finally, in any website leave your twitter address.

That&#039;s all i can say right now.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>A great way to get followers is to join a Twitter train.  You sign up, follow people in the train, and get added to it. Then other people sign up and have to follow you to join the train. Try it here: http://targetfollowers.com</Content>
