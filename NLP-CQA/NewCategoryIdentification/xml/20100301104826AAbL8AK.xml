  <Question id="20100301104826AAbL8AK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why does my Internet browser pop up after loading a page?</Subject>
    <Content>I click on a link, and while the page is loading I open up my iTunes window, for example, but then once IE has loaded the page i wanted it automatically opens up taking me away from iTunes. It gets annoying when you are in the middle of typing and it suddenly pops up with the page i asked for. Yeah i&#039;m glad you&#039;ve opened up the page i wanted, but i will open you in my own time!

    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s something that happens if the page is still a full screen. You can prevent the screen from jumping in front of others if you minimize it. I do the same thing with my msn messengers so if someone nudges me it doesn&#039;t pop up in my face and then I end up typing what I want in the message box.
Just minimize the page before continuing to do other work. That should help.</ChosenAnswer>
