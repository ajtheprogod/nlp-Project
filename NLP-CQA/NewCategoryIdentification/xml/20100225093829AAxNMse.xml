  <Question id="20100225093829AAxNMse" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why can&#039;t I get onto solefootwear.co.uk?</Subject>
    <Content>I saw an ad in a magazine for it, but i can&#039;t get on |:
Is it just me? Can you get on the site?

This is what it says when i try visit the site:
Forbidden
You don&#039;t have permission to access / on this server.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

What is this all about?
Thanks!
