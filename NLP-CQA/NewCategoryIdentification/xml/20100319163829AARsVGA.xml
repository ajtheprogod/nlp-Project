    <ChosenAnswer>Two possible reasons:

1. Are you running a new firewall or port blocker like Peer Guardian or Peer Blocker? I know I can&#039;t run MapleStory with Peer Blocker running.

2. Did you recently update Flash? I&#039;ve had a few older Flash based games bookmarked that don&#039;t work anymore with newer versions of Flash.

Hope that helps!</ChosenAnswer>
