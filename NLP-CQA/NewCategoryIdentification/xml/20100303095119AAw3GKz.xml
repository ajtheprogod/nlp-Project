    <ChosenAnswer>Best thing to do would be to ask the seller if the game is playable.

&#039;Acceptable&#039; means that the game is used -- however I&#039;ve bought used games off of eBay before and never had any problems.

Just ask the seller if the disk is scratched and if the game works. That way when you get it, if it is not the way s/he described it, then you can file a dispute with eBay/PayPal.</ChosenAnswer>
