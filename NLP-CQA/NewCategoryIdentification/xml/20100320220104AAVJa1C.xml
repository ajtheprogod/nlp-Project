    <ChosenAnswer>Does it keep telling you that firefox is unsafe and that it is running a scan and finding viruses? It looks like a windows program. The only way to get rid of it is to buy, install and run malware. It costs about $50.00. I hated this virus as it&#039;s one of the most difficult to get rid of.</ChosenAnswer>

        <Answer>
            <Content>Is it Firefox that keeps popping up or a pop up Window. If it&#039;s a pop up Window, it probably isn&#039;t Firefox causing this. Scan for Malware, not virus scan.</Content>
