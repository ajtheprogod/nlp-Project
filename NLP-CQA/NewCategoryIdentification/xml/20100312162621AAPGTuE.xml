    <Subject>How long do deleted e-mail stay in the trash/deleted e-mails folder on Hotmail and Yahoo Mail?</Subject>
    <Content>I think on Yahoo Mail it might actually tell you somewhere how long the e-mails stay in trash before they are gone for good. I think it&#039;s like 30 days. Does that sound right? I can&#039;t find anything on Hotmail that tells you.
