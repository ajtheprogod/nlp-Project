    <ChosenAnswer>You cannot - that&#039;s the whole point of the site.  You&#039;re completely anonymous unless you choose to give out skype, facebook, msn, etc.  You cannot track someone down on CR because there is nothing that identifies people.  The same thing happened to me.  It sucks so I&#039;d recommend exchanging info if you really like the person bc it freezes and crashes all the time. :(</ChosenAnswer>
