    <Subject>Need people to invite to Lockerz! (more info in description)?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok well, I&#039;m trying to get people to invite to Lockerz. Lockerz is an online site, where basically you earn points by doing things on the site, like watching videos, playing games etc. Only catch is that you have to be invited to join. You get points for logging on and answering a daily question. Once you get enough points you can redeem them by spending them on some pretty cool things like an iPod, some PSP stuff, and a whole lot of other things. I&#039;m still pretty new at this whole thing. My cousin and my friend both got an iPod nano and touch, so I&#039;m sure it&#039;s all legit. I&#039;m really trying to get a Macbook for when I leave to college; I just think it&#039;ll help me out a lot, since I won&#039;t be able to take my desktop. You get points for inviting people, so if anyone is willing to join and help me out, please message me through my profile and leave me your email. I can send you an invite as soon as possible, but you have to join in order for the points to count.
You might need to check your spam, if it doesn&#039;t show up in your inbox
