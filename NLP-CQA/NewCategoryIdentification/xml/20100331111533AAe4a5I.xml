  <Question id="20100331111533AAe4a5I" type="Answered">
    <Subject>internet explorer 8 problem, can you help?</Subject>
    <Content>i recently downloaded 2 what i thought were ad blockers , but one of them didn&#039;t work  and the other one was for advanced users and hard to configure.

i deleted the programs  and now, just recently  , ive noticed  some unusual problems  in my internet explorer 8  browser that i dont know how to fix.

the go buttons have disappeared  ,  the arrows  ,  the address bar has vanished  and so has the google toolbar    -  and it won&#039;t let me reinstall  the google toolbar.

just as a note i do use a host file.

im really not sure what to do ,  im worried if i uninstall internet explorer 8  would i remove all my favourites or favourites bar ?   - i have a lot of stuff in there.

i don&#039;t know what the best course of action should be  ?

my system restore was turned off , so i cant use that ,   im unsure how to unistall int explorer 8  ,  and im worried about removing any of my favourites.


anyone know what to do ?

or how can i get the go arrow buttons back in my browser  ?  how to get the address bar back ?  and how can i install google toolbar ?

i save the google toolbar to my desk  but it tells me what program should i open the installer with ?   and i dont have a clue as im a computer novice .

anyone answer these questions for me ?
