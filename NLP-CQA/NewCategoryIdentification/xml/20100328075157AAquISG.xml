    <Subject>How do I watch videos on Megavideo without the time limit?</Subject>
    <Content>I have tried -
Downloading it with download helper in firefox
downloading it and watching it offline
downloading hotspot and hiding my ip address

I can&#039;t figure it out i don&#039;t want to buy a subscription, it is a ripoff and i heard you still have a time limit.

            <Content>You have to buy the membership deal, there&#039;s no way around it.  You can be a member, but a member without the subscription deal is just like a guest watching a small portion of the video then having it stop on them.</Content>

follow the steps that are shown and then you can watch videos without the limit

        <Answer>
            <Content>Believe me.. There is ways around it. 

Every time my Megavideo time runs out all I do is:

!) Reach over to my Router. 
2) Press the button to turn it off. (or just unplug the power cord)
4)Turn it back on (or plug back in)
5) Megavideo time is reset. 

Thats all.</Content>
            <Reference>This is what I do.</Reference>
