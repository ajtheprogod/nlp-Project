  <Question id="20100309144059AAhAnIL" type="Answered">
    <Subject>AOL Mail says invalid user or password even though I signed in this morning just fine with the SAME password?</Subject>
    <Content>Title says it all; it&#039;s frustrating because that email account had everything in it, including important contacts and emails. And it&#039;s definitely the right password because it&#039;s been the same for YEARS, too. I&#039;ve tried everything... 
~~~ Is there a number I can call to get AOL to reset my password? ~~~
Because the password reset questions are from years ago and I cannot remember them...
OKAY I tried calling AOL support to reset my password, but I don&#039;t have the billing info or zip code since I&#039;ve had this account since I was about 6 years old. HOW TO RESET ?!?
I definitely didn&#039;t type it in wrong or hit caps, btw
