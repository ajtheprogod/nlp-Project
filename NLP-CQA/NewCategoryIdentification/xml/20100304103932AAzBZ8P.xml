    <Subject>Firefox bogging down !?</Subject>
    <Content>Firefox;  A few weeks ago I installed the latest updated version of Firefox. Ever since then things have run very slowly. Pages take 10 - 20 seconds to load, the screen will fade to near white and get this washed out look. Sometimes I get a message stating that &quot;a script on this page is running that may prevent.... referencing Firefox (no I didn&#039;t save the whole thing) the file it references is;   file:///C:/Users/a/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/qtc0ga3l.default/extensions/%7B635abd67-4fe9-1b23-4f01-e679fa7484c1%7D/components/nsYahooFileIO.js:26

    <ChosenAnswer>Consider some of the add-ons you&#039;re running with Firefox. Try disabling them all and restarting your computer, as well as clearing out some of the cache/files.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You may have all the firefox files filled up with old and new programs which causes it to slow right down. Download a program called speedyfox and it will clean out this mess for you and should speed your connections again

            <Content>That almost sounds like some kind of virus.  Normally when my Firefox browser is bogged down it&#039;s because I have way too many tabs open.   Check your task manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del) and see how much RAM firefox.exe is consuming.  If it&#039;s using 100,000k+ RAM off jumpstreet while you only have one tab open then there&#039;s definitely a problem.  

Also, see if you have the same problem in Internet Explorer.  If not, then the problem points directly at Firefox.  Hope I helped a little.</Content>
