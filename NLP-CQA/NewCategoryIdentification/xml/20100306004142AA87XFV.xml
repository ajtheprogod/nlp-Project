    <ChosenAnswer>I tried hundreds of free proxies/vpn&#039;s over many months. All I got out of it was a lot of frustration as they got blocked in short order. Well I got one more thing and that was a virus from one of them that wrecked my HD. Even when they worked for a while they were slow and didn&#039;t support all the web site features. My friend in Riyadh told me about the Personal VPN http://www.surfbouncer.com. He&#039;s kind of an expert on unblocking sites because he lives in a place where pretty much everything fun is blocked.

Anyway, I tried it a few months ago and it&#039;s been working all the time. I haven&#039;t been blocked since and the sites are 100% functional. With the Personal VPN everything works like it&#039;s supposed to. Once connected you don&#039;t even know it&#039;s there. It&#039;s not free but it works perfectly.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It should, although I have never tried. Proxies are usually slow as hell though, so don&#039;t expect it to work well.

You obviously wouldn&#039;t set up your own proxy, you would just use a public one.</Content>

            <Content>You could set up a proxy server in the USA to access Hulu but that would be complicated and expensive. I would give that a miss just due to the cost. Take a look at Tor which is a system for routing your traffic around the world. It is often used for privacy but could be used, providing the exit node is in the United States, to access Hulu.
