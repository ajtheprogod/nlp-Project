  <Question id="20100316205057AAKZkiF" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What&#039;s a good website to meet people?</Subject>
    <Content>I really like to just meet random people for fun. I use Omegle a lot, because it&#039;s anonymous chat, but direct conversations like that can get very awkward and the site is full of people only looking to cyber. I have Facebook but don&#039;t find it&#039;s good for meeting new people. I don&#039;t want Myspace.

Are there any good social networking type sites with focus on meeting people? I&#039;m under 18 btw.

            <Content>My Year Book is the best one in my opinion. I&#039;m constantly meeting new people there. Just be sure and not be too shy to say hello to new friends.</Content>
