    <ChosenAnswer>If you&#039;ve just started in Second Life then you aren&#039;t ready for a job yet.   First you need to learn your way around.   Check out places like NCI or The Shelter.  Both these sims are dedicated to helping newbies get started.

Once you&#039;re comfortable with the SL environment then you can start looking for ways to earn money.  You can learn to build or script and create your own business or look for jobs as a model, dancer, hostess or DJ at a club.   These won&#039;t earn much but you can have fun at the same time.  Just be sure you know what you&#039;re getting into.  A lot of places will advertise for a dancer, but what they really expect is a hooker or stripper.</ChosenAnswer>
