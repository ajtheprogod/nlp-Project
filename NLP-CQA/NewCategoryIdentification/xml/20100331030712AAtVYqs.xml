  <Question id="20100331030712AAtVYqs" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is the best broadband service to get for me?</Subject>
    <Content>My contract with BT ends in a few weeks. I&#039;m debating changing ISP, as BT are fairly dear and have limits on the amount I can download. I just got BBC iPlayer on my Bush Freesat box and obviously iPlayer would eat into my download allowance.

What to do? *nervous*

    <ChosenAnswer>I think the best solution would be to check over some comparison sites such as broadbandchoices.co.uk; I mention this one as different providers have different capabilities and levels of service in different areas and you can check by your postcode, however there are plenty of comparison sites out there.

As with any &quot;what is the best&quot; question, a lot of the answers will contain personal preference; which in my case is O2. I&#039;ve been using them for 2 years, they&#039;re not the cheapest at around 7.50 a month however there has been no down time, no complaints, and it&#039;s unlimited download at 8 mb (or whatever your area can handle).
-&gt; A plus is that they don&#039;t appear to monitor your traffic, or at least if they do they don&#039;t complain about what you use it for.</ChosenAnswer>
