Reason: You are very limited in how you can redeem your points; there is no option to receive cash instead of a gift card. Also you are limited to 5 referrals. If they would increase the number of referrals you were allowed we would have given them a higher rating. We receive about 1 or 2 survey invitations a week. Each survey is worth between 200 to 1500 points, and they take about 15 to 30 min to complete.&quot;

You probably have to be on the site to use those surveys. They may send them to you via email.</ChosenAnswer>
