    <Subject>How fast are your FILE downloads with Verizon DSL 1Mbps or 3Mbps?</Subject>
    <Content>My friend is interested in getting Verizon DSL.  

He can&#039;t get cable because he&#039;s getting free cable  TV.  He didn&#039;t switch it on himself, it was just like that when he moved in.  If the cable company goes to install internet at his house, they will figure out he&#039;s getting cable for free.  (I know, it&#039;s kind of wrong, but that&#039;s not the point of this question.)  

I have cable and I know it&#039;s fast.  But a file only downloads at about 800kbps on cable (a fraction of the overall speed).  So if he can get somewhere near that with DSL I know he&#039;ll be fine.  I want to know how fast a file downloads from Verizon DSL on their 1Mbps or 3Mbps plan.  I&#039;m pretty sure just &quot;surfing the internet&quot; won&#039;t be a problem. 

I&#039;m sure some of you guys can help.  If you know the speed, don&#039;t forget to say whether it&#039;s the 1Mb or 3Mb plan.

    <ChosenAnswer>Did u notice that 1 Mb(megabits) not 1 MB( mega bytes)

so 1 Mb/s = 1/8 MB/s =125KB/s[actual speed because smallest meaningful unit in computer is a byte(8 bits)] . computer uses ascii which is an 8 bit code

similarly 3Mb/s=3/8 MB/s=375KB/s

again 800kbps= 100KB/s (close to 125KB/s) =1Mb plan
which takes 10sec to download a 1MB file</ChosenAnswer>
