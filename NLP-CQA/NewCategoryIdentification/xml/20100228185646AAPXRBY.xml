    <Subject>Some sites where I can talk to strange anonymously?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m kind of now into the meet people online without seeing your face, so I don&#039;t want anything where you see their faces. My friends have been on a couple of those and met some weirdooos! Lol. I&#039;ve already tried omegle.com, but are there any others?
Thanks to anyone who does take this answer seriously.

The site page is a chat screen and the top says &quot;Talk to Strangers&quot;
you can click &quot;begin chat&quot; and a random person whose name on it is &quot;stranger&quot; says hi and you talk.
(to them you are called stranger) completely anonymous. and you can get people from all around the world and ask all types of questions about where they live!</Content>
