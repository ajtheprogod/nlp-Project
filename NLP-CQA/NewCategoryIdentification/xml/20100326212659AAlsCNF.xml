  <Question id="20100326212659AAlsCNF" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there anyway to extend the time the internet tries to load a website before it &quot;times out&quot;?</Subject>
    <Content>There are a few sites that my friends can access on there internet that take a really long time to load but eventually do. But my internet gives up on those sites before they have the chance to load and gives me a &quot;The connection has timed out&quot; message. Is there a way to make it keep loading for as long as it takes, or at least longer then its trying? I prefer Mozilla but if you only know internet explorer that&#039;s fine too.
