  <Question id="20100319133253AATI9CF" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I&#039;m looking for a new forum. Any ideas?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve been posting on a website that just lost a lot of their community over tyrannical moderators and a butthurt community manager. I&#039;m looking for a forum that has lax rules, a nontopic board, but still gets a moderate amount of traffic. I dont want to get banned for dropping a f-bomb. I&#039;m fine with a tough community that doesn&#039;t like newcomers, i know how that works. I also am a gamer, so I&#039;d prefer a gaming community. Oh, and one more thing, IGN can stuff it.
