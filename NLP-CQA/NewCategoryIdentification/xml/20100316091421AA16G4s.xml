    <Subject>I keep getting followed by people associated with PLR. Should I block them?</Subject>
    <Content>My business Twitter account has received multiple follows the last few days from people associated with PLR (Private Label right) content websites. Should I block them? They seem spammy. If they are, I don&#039;t want to be associated with them. Thanks! Dan

    <ChosenAnswer>You can block them by protecting your tweets.In this way they&#039;ll have to send a request to follow you.Then in the friends request you can decide which guys you should allow and which you shouldnt.
