  <Question id="20100310042417AA8fQXJ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is the best place to share direct download files?</Subject>
    <Content>As torrents are out I&#039;d like to find a place to post direct download links. I have been using http://tehparadox.com but I&#039;m not entirely thrilled with the ability (or inability) to sign up for a new account. I also don&#039;t think a forum type setup is the most friendly. (I have an account but want to use my TPB username and the register new account isn&#039;t working.)

I like http://www.movies-megaupload.com/ but you can&#039;t share on it. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for good sharing sites?
