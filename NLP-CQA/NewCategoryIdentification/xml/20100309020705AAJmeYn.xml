    <ChosenAnswer>I sell items on EBay and on a local auction site. Most of my items comes from yards sales, flea markets, discount bins at local stores, etc. I sell larger items locally, less shipping charges etc. Most customers will gladly pick up the items. Sometimes I buy items from the local site just to sell on EBay. You can get the same type of information that some people offer for sale just by checking out the Ebay site for free!</ChosenAnswer>

You get a money producing affiliate website, and you keep 100% commission.
The only thing is, you need to learn some SEO. You&#039;ll get some training to market it and everything. There is a Pro option that you can choose later on if you wish.</Content>
