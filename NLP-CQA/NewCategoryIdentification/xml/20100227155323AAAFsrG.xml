    <Subject>Lockerz prize redemption?</Subject>
    <Content>Me and my brother each have our own Lockerz account. If we were to get alot of PTZ and get a prize, can we send it to the same house? Basicly, are we allowed to have more than one account per household?
PLEASE TELL ME HOW YOU FOUND OUT YOUR ANSWER.

    <ChosenAnswer>They do have a prize redemption about once a month. It lasts for about 30min. Lockez does not announce when itll be. So there is a very slim chance of winning a prize. If you look on there facebook wall itll have comments on it. And yeah they don&#039;t really have a way of telling if youve got two accounts as long as there two different emails.

Just a suggestion but you should look into Swagbucks. Much better then Lockerz. Prizes are always available. If you chose to sign up please use my referral link. http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The people who run Lockerz have avoided prison by not promising any particular prize to anyone.

The &quot;waves&quot; of prize lotteries grant someone the extremely rare prize that everyone wants, and everyone else gets nothing, or has to settle for wallpaper or donating to charity.

It&#039;s like the McDonalds Monopoly game where there is only one rare piece to win the grand prize. Everone else just gets small fries.

Don&#039;t waste your time there.</Content>
