  <Question id="20100225175911AAzdlYG" type="Answered">
    <Subject>how much would it total cost to run cable .8 miles?</Subject>
    <Content>see we live out in the sticks. And after waiting 2 months on a waiting list for them to come install our internet they tell us they do not offer service out here.  I was just wondering how much would it cost to run the cable out to our house from the highway?  Our house is just over .8 miles from the highway so we don&#039;t have to put up with hughes net rediculous &quot;FAIR USAGE AGREEMENT&quot; and so i can play my playstation 3 online!
its 8 tenths of a mile. 
and the question is asking what the total cost would be.

    <ChosenAnswer>Well I live 1050 feet from the end of the cable and they wanted about $2200 to lay cable and install an amplifier for cable TV.   I got Dish Network TV and I wish I had paid for the cable, but I am still too far away from the switching station to use the cable for internet.  If your house is over 18000 feet (I think that is the correct figure) round trip from the station you will not be able to use it for internet either.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If by &quot;hughes net&quot; u are referring to a satellite system, then u can&#039;t use that to play online games anyway.  This is because there is a dual lag as the signal travels to and from the satellite twice.  Light travels fast, but not that fast.</Content>

            <Content>Well if you were to buy increments of 100 ft of Coaxial Cable it would be around 700$ exact amount would be $643.31 just for the cable but you would need connectors to connect each 100 ft of cable. and thats buying coaxial cable cheap from this site
