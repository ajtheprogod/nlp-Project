    <ChosenAnswer>There&#039;s always dial-up, but that sucks inordinately. There&#039;s always satellite, but that really, really sucks in its own way.

If you can get decent cell reception, then a cellular data plan and USB stick is the way to go. It&#039;s not ideal as they&#039;ll cap your monthly transfers most of the time, but it&#039;s usually the best option in this kind of situation.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If you get a cell phone signal get a 3G or 4G USB adapter and use the cell phone data stream to access the net. Mucho expensive tho.</Content>

            <Content>Dear I love your problem.

I have a suggestion for your Problem. I dont know which kind of Internet Connection you are using that is wireless if this.
then
Take a Long Wire 15 to 20 feet long of Copper which used for CABLE Connection or TV Antina or for Home Wiring called 3/0.29 Insulated Single Wire, Connect a wire PROPERLY Tight with your Wireless Modem ENTENA or its Point after removing its Insulation from one end of the wire, and second end of this wire Connect into a TREE after Removed the TREE SKIN or TIGHT this wire second End with a SCREW  then TIGHTLY insert this screw into TREE, 
Your Modem will pick the Signal and Internet will work Properly,
If you dont have a TREE then Take any Silver Plate which used in the Kitchen Accessories  connect the wire as above mention proceedure.

Thanks
