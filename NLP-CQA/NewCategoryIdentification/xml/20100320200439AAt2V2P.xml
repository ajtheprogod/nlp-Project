    <ChosenAnswer>I would try running a virus scan and running a program called CCleaner. It cleans out all of the temporary files, registry errors, and other stuff that slows down your PC. The links to Lavasoft AdAware and CCleaner (both free) are below:

I hope this helped.

And by the way, don&#039;t joke about suicide...a classmate of mine took his own life about two months ago.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Computers get old (like mine) and when it&#039;s time for a change, it&#039;s time for a change.
But sometimes it&#039;s just the Internet itself being slow and it&#039;s got nothing to do with your computer getting old or having viruses at all. What times do you use the Internet? Maybe that&#039;s the problem. Or maybe there&#039;re just too many files/programs/games on your comp. Once I downloaded the Sims2 and my computer just slowed majorly.</Content>
