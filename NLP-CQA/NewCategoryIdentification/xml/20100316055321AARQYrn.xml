    <ChosenAnswer>If your web browser is redirecting you to a different site, most likely it&#039;s caused by some sort of Spyware, Malware, etc. Scan your computer, if nothing is detected try uninstalling &amp; reinstalling your browser.Check your firewall settings &amp; spam filter settings.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Browsers just read a webpage and display it for you. They in themselves don&#039;t re-direct. If you&#039;re being re-directed it will be because the website you are visiting is telling your browser to re-direct you. I can&#039;t tell you anything more than that without you giving more details as to what site this is happening on and where you&#039;re being re-directed to.</Content>
