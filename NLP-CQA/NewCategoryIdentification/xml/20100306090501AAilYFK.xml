  <Question id="20100306090501AAilYFK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is the first thing that comes to mind when searching online for refrigerator repair service.?</Subject>
    <Content>Lets say you&#039;ve woken up this morning, and when you grabbed the milk for your kid&#039;s breakfast, you realized it was not as cold as normal, you check the rest of the food in the fridge, and it too is getting warmer. You dont have a phone book cuz you only have a cell phone, so you decide to search online.

What would you type for your search query  if you wanted to find a qualified refrigerator repair company, that wouldnt charge an arm and a leg to come out quick, to fix your refrigerator ASAP.
three good answers, im hoping for a few more...first thing that comes to mind...you type in the phrase...?
