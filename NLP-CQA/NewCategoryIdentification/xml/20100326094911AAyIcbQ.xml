    <Subject>Whats the best Instant Messanger?</Subject>
    <Content>I was using MSN but theres a few ppl on there I dont want to talk to anymore so when I log on I need to be appear offline just so i dont get a bunch of messages from them.
Whats a good IM program that isnt a memory hog, has file sharing, im, and voice chatting 
I don&#039;t want to have to get a new email address either so I dont want yahoo i want to set it up with my main hotmail acct
I want something thats not a website - like myspace or facebook but something i can use while on a game or surfing or doing homework and stuff
Why would I want a new email, I dont want a bunch of email addresses just to chat.
I dont block them becuase I have to see them IRL &amp; its easier if im not on it then 2 lie, which is y im looking for a new non website based im

    <ChosenAnswer>Pointless to answer if you arent going to accept creating a new email. You are simply stuck with MSN messenger! Yahoo messenger is the best period.</ChosenAnswer>
