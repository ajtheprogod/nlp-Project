  <Question id="20100221165756AAZuzk3" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can a public webpage be made into a copy?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m not sre if it was possible but a friend said they made one of their favorite websites by copying it and editing the pages in a different url leaving the original un harmed. She said that she was only using it with me and our group of friends only but I&#039;m not sure. 

I have denied to register over and will tell her parents (yes we still have parents) if its illegal. 
She has in each page at least once &quot; layout and graphics by www. (the website she copied) .com&quot;  

I just don&#039;t want any one getting in trouble for participating in illegal act (if it is) so I&#039;m keeping the url a secret

my question is: can someone legally copy a page and paste in in a secret url forever?
