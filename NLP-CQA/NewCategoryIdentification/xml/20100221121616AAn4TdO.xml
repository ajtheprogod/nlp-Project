  <Question id="20100221121616AAn4TdO" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Browser doesn&#039;t load (5mins broken-5 mins works-...) while I do have internet connection?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m having this problem for a pretty long time now. Any browser I try can&#039;t load any pages during some time (usually +-5 min). After that it runs fine for about 5 mins and then stops loading any new page for another period of +-5 min, this cycle keeps repeating.

I do have internet connections in the moments the browsers are not working (I can talk to people on msn messenger etc).

Anyone got any idea on how to solve this?
tried these browsers (all are running and down at same periods of time): IE, firefox, chrome, cometbird
its not my overall speed thats bad, its periods it doesnt work at all and periods it works really good
