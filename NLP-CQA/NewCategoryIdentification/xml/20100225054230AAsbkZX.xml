  <Question id="20100225054230AAsbkZX" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there anychance that you can LOCK internet web pages?</Subject>
    <Content>Say if lots of people were to use a computer, and you only wanted them to use ONE page, Is there a way of doing that? So they couldn&#039;t go on anyother website, Just the one you&#039;ve locked and its pages?

Say if you were to Lock Youtube to the Homepage, Users could look at all the Video&#039;s in Youtube, But couldn&#039;t navigate off it?

I&#039;ve been looking around for ages and nothing has come up what so ever.

Anyone?

    <ChosenAnswer>It can be done fairly easily if you know how to change your network settings.  Change the DNS server settings to an IP address that won&#039;t resolve any websites.  Then add the site names and IP addresses to the &quot;host&quot; file.  The users will still be able to get to websites IF they already know the IP addresses, which most people don&#039;t.
I could add more detail but that&#039;s already available in lots of places.  If you understand what I am referring to above then you will be able to get the detail and have this done in just a couple of minutes.</ChosenAnswer>
