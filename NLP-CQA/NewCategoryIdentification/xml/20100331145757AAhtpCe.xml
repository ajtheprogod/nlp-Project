    <ChosenAnswer>VoIP, voice over internet protocol, callls PC to PC on skype are free all you need is a cam and headset n mic. call to land lines and mobiles cost, Freecall.com you can connect landline to landline for 0.5 euro connection and talk for free, you set them up as an international call, the computer call both numbers and the is used as a &quot;bridge&quot; (baby telephone exchange) to connect the call. you charge up account in  15 euro blocks and use. I use it to call my mum interstate AU, there are a few companies around so research, ADSL services with VOiP phones are ok to? Prices will vary.</ChosenAnswer>
