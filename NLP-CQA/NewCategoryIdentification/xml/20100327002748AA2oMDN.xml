  <Question id="20100327002748AA2oMDN" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Skype: Can you make your status invisible to specific people without blocking them?</Subject>
    <Content>I am friends with a guy who likes talking a little too much on Skype. I decided I would try and block him, but when I went to it said he would be removed from my contact list. If I do this will he know I have removed him?

The reason I ask is because I don&#039;t want to offend him, he is a nice guy but a bit too chatty on Skype. I can&#039;t set my status to invisible as I want my other friends to know I am online. What can I do?
