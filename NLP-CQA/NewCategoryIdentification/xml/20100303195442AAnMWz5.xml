    <ChosenAnswer>He probably accidentally turned off his wireless card. Try hitting the &quot;FN&quot; button next to the Windows button and F2 to turn the wireless &quot;radio&quot; back on. If this works mention to him that I also suggested that unconditionally loving and democratic parents are essential to mental health and that critical and controlling parents are a one way ticket to therapy.</ChosenAnswer>
