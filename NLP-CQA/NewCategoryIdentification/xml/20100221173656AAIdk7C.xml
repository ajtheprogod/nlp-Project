    <Subject>Can I purchase seller items with credit that eBay gave me?</Subject>
    <Content>I received credit from eBay, because they charged me for a transaction that the buyer backed out of.  Can I use that credit to put toward my purchase of an item that someone is selling?

    <ChosenAnswer>Sure! It should show up in your My Ebay control panel.

It isn&#039;t really a question about how to find stuff to sell but more of a question of finding items THAT sell. There are tons of people who have tried to sell items they bought wholesale on Ebay and end up with only a few clicks/views. There is a trick that Power Sellers use to find the &quot;Hot Items&quot;. &quot;Hot Items&quot; are those that get alot of views which therefore get alot of buys.
