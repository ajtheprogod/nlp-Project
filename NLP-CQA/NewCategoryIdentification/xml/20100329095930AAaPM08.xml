    <Subject>chatroulette log in issues?</Subject>
    <Content>I keep getting an &quot;entering chatroulette...&quot; error?
Some days are worse than others. Just about everyday I cant log in, it just freezes up displaying that error message. Sometimes refreshing the page helps and sometimes it doesnt.  Anyone know why this happens? and more importantly what to do to prevent it from happening again?
Christelle- email sent to you.  Thanks for answering!

    <ChosenAnswer>There is basicaly nothing you can do about it.

The site is just overcrowded... Here in Western Europe (I&#039;m French, sorry for my english), the best moment are between 10 am to 3 pm (meaning for you if you live on the East Coast between 4 am and 9 am)... The worse moment is on week-ends when Europeans who are finishing their parties (3 am here, 9 pm for you Eastern time) are connected with Americans begining their parties...

My advice : start to live a life based on European time. Add 5 hours for London, 6 Hours for Paris, 7 hours for Athens, 8 hours for Moscow... 

I much prefer the Europeans hours. I don&#039;t mean any harm : but Americans are quite boring on chatroulette compared to Europeans. What do u think?</ChosenAnswer>
