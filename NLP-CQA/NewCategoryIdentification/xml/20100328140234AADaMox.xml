  <Question id="20100328140234AADaMox" type="Answered">
    <Subject>how come there never used to be advertisements on yahoo answers and now there is?</Subject>
    <Content>when i first signed up for an account in late 2006  on yahoo answers, i dont remember &#039; ever &#039; seeing any intrusive, distracting advertisements  -  over the last year or so  it seems now they are a fixed , permanent feature.

i find them distracting and annoying at best  .  i despise them.

ive managed to block them on google chrome useing an ad block,  ive also blocked them on firefox  , but there are tons of ad ons on firefox  it keeps  freezing  and doesn&#039;t operate too well.

but  i notice the ads  are still showing on internet explorer  ,  i thought  i blocked them with a host file,  blocker   -  but the ads are still managing to show through..


is there any effective way i can block the ads through internet explorer ?

i really dont like them,  i resent their presence  and they ruin my enjoyment of yahoo answers.
