    <ChosenAnswer>Birthdays - no.

Addresses - perhaps. You could try an online phonebook if you know what city they live in, although obviously that will only list whoever has the phone registered to their name (so you&#039;ll have to know who that is - you won&#039;t be able to look up every individual person).

With the exception of the phonebook, there aren&#039;t any huge public databases that just have this information for anyone to use.</ChosenAnswer>
