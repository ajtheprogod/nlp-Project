  <Question id="20100308173519AA0epyK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Would Safari be compatible with an HP Compaq computer with Windows 7?</Subject>
    <Content>The reason why i&#039;m asking this is because i searched Safari on wikipedia, it said that Safari  was compatible with Windows 7, but when i clicked on the click to download Safari it said it Mac + PC.

All i want to know: is Safari compatible with an HP Compaq computer with Windows 7?
I have firefox, but it&#039;s french. I would like to have another english browser other than AOL, i used to use Internet Explorer before i found out that it had security issues now.

My current browsers are:
AOL (english)
Google Chrome (spanish)
Opera (portuguese)
Flock (italian)
Firefox (french)
SeaMonkey (german)

            <Content>Yes but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. There have been known security issues that Apple seems to ignore. Use Firefox. It&#039;s a better browser anyway.</Content>
