    <ChosenAnswer>You could use something like  Netnanny along with microsoft steadystate to prevent people from turning it off, 

if you have a server you can do it that way

if you have a good enough router you can do it through the admin interface there.

There are a few ways .. none perfect but all better than nothing.

Hope that helps.</ChosenAnswer>
