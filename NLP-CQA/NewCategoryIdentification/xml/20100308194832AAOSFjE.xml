    <Subject>Is Encyclopedia Dramatica illegal to be on?</Subject>
    <Content>Most of the content on the site is kinda... offensive. i was told by wikipedia to go on the site for information on memes and I was just wondering if it&#039;s illegal to be navigating the site because this page said the FBI was watching me and something about underaged girls.

    <ChosenAnswer>...Why would it be illegal? If a site is illegal to be on, it&#039;s because the site itself is illegal, and thus would get shut down. Unless it&#039;s only illegal in your country, which is true for some stuff... but anyway, no of course it isn&#039;t.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It&#039;s probably not illegal, but it might not be something you want to browse at work.</Content>
