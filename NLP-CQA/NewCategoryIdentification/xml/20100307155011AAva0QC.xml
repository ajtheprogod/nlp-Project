    <ChosenAnswer>Yes you can whether you in the process of preparing your listing or if you have listed it already (you will still pay a fee if you have) If the item has no bids chose end the listing early in the dropdown menu. I dont think you can end it early if the auction has 12 hours or less to go (not 100% sure on this, its been years since Ive ended a listing early, might be a good idea to read ebays selling tutorials see the site map or selling help)</ChosenAnswer>
