    <ChosenAnswer>Most websites especially like facbook will be open to weirdos, Facebook can be as safe as you make it.
The settings allow you to selects exactly who you want to view what, you can even choose specific friends to hide things from.
I would advise hiding all information to anyone who isn&#039;t a direct friend of yours, and only add people who you know and trust.
This way you know who your allowing to see you photos and info, as people can&#039;t see if unless you accept.
And generally don&#039;t put to much personal info up (i.e. address, phone number..)

There are other socail networking sites such as bebo and myspace but all are open to anyone and i dont know if they&#039;re much better.

hope this helps slightly.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Well theres yahoo, gmail, hotmail and stuff at these sites you add your friends and then email them and you can also put them on instant chat and then talk instantly. But make sure you only add people you know. Facebook is pretty safe. only the people you know as your friends on facebook can see your profile or anything. And you can block people so they know absolutely nothing about you But it depends on your age. I got my facebok when i was 12 but some parents dont want you to be that young. :D.</Content>
