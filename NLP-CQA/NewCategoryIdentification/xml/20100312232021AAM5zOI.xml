    <ChosenAnswer>Best advise I can give you from my years of experience would be this.

Find something you are passionate about and blog about that.

Don&#039;t worry if it&#039;s something someone will read, just do it for yourself.

I know 1 person who turned his hobby of raising chickens into a very popular blog that is now making him money.  Now this didn&#039;t happen over night of course, it took about a year before things really started to happen, but since then it has simply got better.
