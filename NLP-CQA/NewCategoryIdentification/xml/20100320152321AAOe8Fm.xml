    <ChosenAnswer>Amazon is your best bet for something like that.  For a small item, the shipping should be under $5.  You can find the shipping rates by clicking on the link below.  Also, you can just order the item, and it will tell you how much the shipping is, and if it&#039;s too much, you can just cancel.  On eBay, once you&#039;ve bid, you really need to go through with the sale, and you might not know the exact amount.

I would go with the standard shipping, which usually gets there almost as fast as the 2-day.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Ebay charge the seller fees not the buyer, if you buy an item on Ebay you just pay for the item plus shipping which should be clearly stated. The seller pays all the fees involved in the transaction.</Content>
            <Reference>Ebay seller since 2002</Reference>
