  <Question id="20100303213402AALczby" type="Answered">
    <Subject>am having trouble linking to webpages from links?</Subject>
    <Content>Just of recent, whenever I receive an email with a link or thread (by the way, is this the same thing?!!), I can, in no way link.  If I click on the link I just get an &quot;empty reaction&quot;, i.e. the page stays where it is and nothing opens up.  Being as most emails tend to have some kind of link, this is getting to be quite frustrating.  Okay, I know that I can always &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;paste&quot; onto a web page, but this tends to become a little long winded when I have alot of post to deal with.  Can anyone tell me, why this is happening and if possible how to repair this problem.  P.S.  I would be interested to know if the terms &quot;thread&quot; and &quot;link&quot; are the same thing.  My IT jargon isn&#039;t that great!!  Thanks
