  <Question id="20100225060621AAWCO1K" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Where can I create a forum with liberal censorship policies?</Subject>
    <Content>I spent a considerable time creating a completely inoffensive forum on xobor.com for a group I run and just when it was getting established I found that xobor had deleted it, presumably because in one of the posts there was a joking reference to pornography - not a link - just the word &#039;porn&#039;. This really gets on my nerves

So does anyone know of a website where I can start a free forum, with the freedom to make it look the way I want - uploading own backgrounds, html banner etc., but also one that allows users to say more or less whatever they want?

This being the internet, I shouldn&#039;t really have to ask - I thought this was the last remaining &#039;pirate utopia&#039; so to speak - but there we go. Censors 1, us 0.

    <ChosenAnswer>Based on the boards I&#039;ve seen hosted there, proboards.com seems reasonable in terms of censorship, but I can&#039;t comment on the ease of customization since I only used it as a regular member, not an admin.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You should ask Xobor why they deleted your forum.  It is unlikely to be for the reason you cite.  I am several music forums - membership predominately male - and there is often passing reference to porn, although the members are basically respectable middle aged males</Content>
