    <Subject>Does anyone know about or have you ever gotten a &quot;free&quot; IPhone on the net?</Subject>
    <Content>I know this is the number one internet no no, but there are all these sites saying, &quot;no scam no credit card just fill out these forums.&quot; I mean Im so down to fill out an hours worth of sucky forums for a free super ipod, so if you have ever had an experience with these things(good or bad) or know someone who has then please give me the low down on these sketchy little deals.
