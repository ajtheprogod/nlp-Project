    <ChosenAnswer>If she can get on live messenger she has a working IP connection. 

Drop to dos and ping Yahoo.com.   If it says it can&#039;t resolve the address you have a DNS issue.  Make sure that your wireless adapter is set to accept DNS from the router.

If DNS is ok and the web site answers then you have a browser issue.   Go to your explorer settings and make sure you are not set to use a proxy that doesn&#039;t exist.</ChosenAnswer>
