    <ChosenAnswer>If soulds as if the game is compressed.  Windows XP SP2 should be able to uncompress it, if it is a .zip extention.  If any other extention you might need. 7-zip to uncompress it. http://download.cnet.com/7-Zip/3000-2250_4-10045185.html?tag=mncol it is a free download.

If that does not work then try a web search on the extention to find what program is needed to run it.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>hmmm... Firstly, you didn&#039;t told exactly what extension is at the end of the program/ what type of file it is... From where did you downloaded it? What game? You should have elaborated it buddy... :) All I think is that you didn&#039;t complete the download or some file is missing...</Content>
