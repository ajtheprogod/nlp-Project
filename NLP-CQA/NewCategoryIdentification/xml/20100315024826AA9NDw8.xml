  <Question id="20100315024826AA9NDw8" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Do People Know Who You Are Following on Formspring?</Subject>
    <Content>Just made an account after a few months of just posting questions and I was wondering if the person you follow knows that you are following them.

Or is following a person just becomming a friend with them?
Or how about someone just explains this whole &quot;following&quot; crap.
Thanks

            <Content>There is no way for someone to see you are following them. Following is basically just having those peoples post show up on your page everytime they get something new. If you unfollow them, their posts won&#039;t come up anymore.</Content>
