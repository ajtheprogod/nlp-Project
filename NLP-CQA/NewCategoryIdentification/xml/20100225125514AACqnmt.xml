    <ChosenAnswer>yeah i got them, but my advice to you is not to go anywhere near them they are horrible scams to get personal information, credit car details and most of them can give you viruses. it has happened to me before.

when you see advertisement for free stuff like that don&#039;t even click it and if it pops up close it.

            <Content>Most, if not all of them are scams. The email chain ones only open you up for receiving boatloads of junk email and spam.</Content>

            <Content>DON&#039;T go for them. Here is why
Most will ask you to sign up for some service where you will end up paying weekly or monthly fee.
If you don&#039;t sign up for services you cant get those items for free.
If you do sign up for such offers, I would recommend that you read terms and condition. if you are signing up for trial offer, be sure to cancel them before trial ends to avoid recurring fees.</Content>
