    <Subject>Blue screens after Firefox update?</Subject>
    <Content>I updated Firefox yesterday (from 3.6 to the ltest version) and immediately thereafter it crashed and wouldn&#039;t load back up. I ignored it and turned off my computer; however, on boot up today my computer is now getting hit by blue screens and crashing on boot up. What can I do? I going to try and uninstall through safemode plus check drivers through my other partition. Does anyone know what is going on?
