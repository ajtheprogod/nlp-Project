    <ChosenAnswer>In all reality, IE7 and IE8 aren&#039;t all that different and won&#039;t offer that much difference in terms of functionality.  IE8 just has a few more new features (like compatibility mode, which is nice), but is it absolutely worth upgrading to?  No, not really.  I upgraded to IE8 to stay current and have not had any problems with it (no bugs).  So it&#039;s really up to you on whether or not you should upgrade.  There just really isn&#039;t much difference between the two versions.

Others on here have recommended that you switch to Firefox or Google Chrome.  If you are interested, either one is a fine browser and is quite a bit faster than IE, but if you want to change, I would recommend Firefox over Chrome.  Chrome is way too over simplified and I&#039;ve found Firefox to be slightly faster.

Hopefully this helped.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I use Google Chrome at home. At work, I accidentally upgraded to IE8, and now the web-based application I have to use to take attendance and enter grades crashes every IE window I have open, every time I try to use it. Eventually, I&#039;ll have to uninstall it and reinstall an earlier version. In the meantime, I&#039;ve been using a different computer to take attendance.</Content>
