            <Content>Do you have a music program in your school? You could get piano lessons in school and they teach you how to read music as well, that&#039;s how I learned and progressed to lessons out of school and I&#039;m quite good now. For guitar, do you have any musical people in your family, or a friend you know who knows how to play? Or you could get lessons out of school. There may be sites you can go to, but they might cost money. 
Learning to speak French. Go to the library, you can get DVDs and cassettes that teach you words and how to pronounce them. Also, you can maybe try a French dictionary, or, again, get lessons.

Good luck with your goals :)</Content>

            <Content>Let&#039;s see... when I was learning to play guitar, I always went on youtube... the uploaders teach you basics and what not... when you finally put those basics and skills together, then you search for song tutorials...</Content>
            <Reference>sorry...that&#039;s all I have... I learned how to play piano at age 3 so I don&#039;t really need research on that... same goes with reading notes and music... but french? I haven&#039;t had any experience...</Reference>
