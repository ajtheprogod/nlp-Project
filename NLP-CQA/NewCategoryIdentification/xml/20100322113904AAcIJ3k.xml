  <Question id="20100322113904AAcIJ3k" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can You Help Me With Microsoft OfficeLive &amp; Adobe Dreamweaver?</Subject>
    <Content>I have been trying for three days...
To figure out how to add another page to my website ( http://bradleyhowington.com )
Okay...

So I am using a Website Template (already created for me.)
I am using Adobe Dreamweaver as my site design software.
And Microsoft OfficeLive is my hosting site. 

My Question is:
When you have the Template opened in Dreamweaver, how do you link your pages/create them to work with OfficeLive? Your &quot;Contact, Blog, Photos, ...etc&quot; pages.

How do you upload another web page?
Say you have your homepage...
How would you upload the &quot;Contact&quot; page to OfficeLive?

I am so sorry if I have confused you with this crap.
:/

    <ChosenAnswer>Well to start - get rid of Microsoft Office Live Hosting. 

It is extremely restricted and especially if you are using Dreamweaver because they don&#039;t work together well.  

There are so many easier ways to setup exactly what you need.  I would start by buying a hosting server (for great choices http://thehostjudge.com/fullcomparison.html ), then using Dreamweaver alone without Microsoft to create your site. Then work from there with wordpress as your blog.  I hope this helps..let me know if you have any other questions I&#039;d be happy to answer them.</ChosenAnswer>
