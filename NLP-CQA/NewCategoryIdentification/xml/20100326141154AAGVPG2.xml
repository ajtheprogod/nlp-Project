    <Subject>How much does it allow for a rapidshare premium user to download perday?</Subject>
    <Content>and what are the options that I have when my daily downloads are finished?

Thank you

    <ChosenAnswer>Just download one of the premium downloaders from the site in my source. You can use them with a free account and you don&#039;t have to worry about the bandwidth or time restrictions. Plus you can download as many as you want. They work great. When you go to the site, it doesn&#039;t really matter which one you get as they all pretty much have the same features and do the same thing for what you need.

Good luck!</ChosenAnswer>
