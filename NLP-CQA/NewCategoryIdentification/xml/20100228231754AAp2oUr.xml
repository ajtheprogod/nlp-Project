    <Subject>New report system on Chat Roulette? Oops.Someone reported you. Locked out of Chatroulette!?</Subject>
    <Content>Who else has gotten this?:Oops.. Someone reported you. Sorry, but you can&#039;t use the service for the next 10 minutes. And even if you type in a word such as &quot;tits&quot; it warns to kick you off the service. What&#039;s the deal?
No, all it takes is ONE person to hit the Report button rather than Next and ur banned. I wasn&#039;t even doing anything.

            <Content>The deal is exactly what it says. Someone reported you because they didn&#039;t like something you said or something, so you have to wait 10 minutes to get back on.</Content>

            <Content>So much for the loose fun of the early internet.

Seriously, though, take a quick break... walk around, grab a snack, use the bathroom, check your email, say hi to Mom, and come back.</Content>

            <Content>The same thing happened to me, I just waved to this person and then the same message popped up. Hopefully they figure out some new system to avoid this. Otherwise Chatroulette will be a lot less fun.</Content>

            <Content>I agree it is way too easy to ban/report people. It is giving to much of the power to narrow minded people. I got banned for asking some guy and I quote &quot;what&#039;s the image on your t-shirt?&quot; I agree there should be a system which keeps an eye on the subject matter but this seems to be creating a problem in reverse. People are banning others just to be a nuisance.</Content>
