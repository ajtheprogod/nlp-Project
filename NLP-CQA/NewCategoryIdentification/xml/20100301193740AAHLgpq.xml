    <ChosenAnswer>It depends on the reason that it doesn&#039;t work.  Odds are you have some form of malware.  The first thing I would do it open up IE and click &#039;Tools&#039; then &#039;Internet Options&#039;.  After that click &#039;Connections&#039; &#039;Lan Settings&#039; and make sure that everything there is unchecked.  After that try to download malwarebytes or superantispyware.  I bet that&#039;ll get you going again.</ChosenAnswer>
