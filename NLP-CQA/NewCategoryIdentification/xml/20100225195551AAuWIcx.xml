    <ChosenAnswer>The better question to ask is how long would the power stations run without human supervision?

The internet would stop the instant everyone on the Earth died. The internet is more an idea than an electronic network. Without people to produce, surf, write email, and answer Yahoo questions, the internet would instantly pause forever till the power went out and then it would be gone forever.

This was a pretty depressing question, you want someone to talk to Gabe? Email me.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Well..... considering the internet doesn&#039;t technically need people to run, it would probably last a long long long time. Although, if no one was alive, the internet would run into many problems and bugs, but no one would be here to fix them. Also, no one would know how long it would last b/c no one is alive.
