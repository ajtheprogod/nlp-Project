    <ChosenAnswer>Yes, both methods, buying and selling. They are safe and effective if you use common sense and don&#039;t let your guard down.

Don&#039;t trust a single thing you read or are told unless there are pictures or other proof to back it up. Do not trust anyone until they prove their trustworthiness, and even then be cautious.

Any transactions done outside of Ebay should be made in person. NEVER accept money orders or personal checks, only cash or credit card.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I&#039;ve purchased *many* things off e-bay and a few from craigslist.

Just use common sense and be careful. If anything about the item or the people involved seems suspicious, then just walk away from it. Check feedback (if it&#039;s available) especially anything negative and then judge for yourself if it&#039;s a legit complaint or not. And always, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</Content>
