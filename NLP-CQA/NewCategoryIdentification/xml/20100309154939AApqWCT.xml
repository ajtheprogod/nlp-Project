  <Question id="20100309154939AApqWCT" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What to do when I&#039;ve forgotten UIC&#039;s net id password?</Subject>
    <Content>It&#039;s VERY important for me to obtain my password for UIC&#039;s net id system! 
If I dont log in to fill in housing applications, I may not get housing.
I know my username, and I emailed consult@uic.edu for help. I only received an automated letter in return &amp; that didn&#039;t help my situation.
So to anyone who has forgotting their Net ID password before, could you possibly direct me as to what I can do to know my password ASAP??
thank you to all who read this! :)
