  <Question id="20100322162654AAHek7l" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Unbelievably awful internet speeds? Download speed LOWER than upload?</Subject>
    <Content>I have TalkTalk broadband, and I get download speeds at an average of 4kb/s most days, up to an absolute maximum of 45kb/s, and I&#039;m not joking... It&#039;ll take me a couple of minutes to download a 1mb file on most nights.
Not only this, but my upload speed is actually hioher than my download?!
That will often run at around 50kb/s.

Does anyone know the cause of this? I have 100% signal strength (sitting next to router), Belkin N Series router, and even my wired desktop computer is the same.

Thanks in advance, any advice is appreciated.
About 200 metres away, I know some houses get speeds get download speeds of up to 800kb/s. Although the south west of England isn&#039;t exactly known for good internet speeds, mine is just pathetic.

            <Content>Sometimes your speed depends on your location. Also it has most likely nothing to do with your router. I saw on their website that they offer free support so you should call them.</Content>
