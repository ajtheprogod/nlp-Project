    <ChosenAnswer>Use a reverse phone lookup. Most will make you pay to view results. The number appears to be in the directory at http://www.phonerecordsdirectory.com/uk/?id=ph but they want to charge $29.95 USD for a 1 year subscription. If it&#039;s worth 20 quid for a shot at an answer (no guarantee it&#039;ll be the one you&#039;re looking for) then give it a go.</ChosenAnswer>
