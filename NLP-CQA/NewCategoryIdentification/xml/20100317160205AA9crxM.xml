    <ChosenAnswer>Probably as if they began charging they would loose business to hotmail, yahoo ect.
So it makes sense to keep it free, maybe offering a premium package if necessarry.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Don&#039;t know but I only use it for file storage/ sharing and to access multiple email accounts. If they start charging for it I&#039;ll use something else instead!</Content>

            <Content>Thanks for asking, I was wondering the same thing! I have a Hotmail account currently, but I use GMX for work. I think it will- but I don&#039;t recommend it. When I use GMX it&#039;s very slow and the setup and look of the inbox is very different and complicated. I would use Hotmail. Hotmail has 2GB storage, and it&#039;s free, and, also, if you have a Windows 7 computer like me, you can hook up your e-mail to make things more compatible on your PC. =D I hope this answer really helps. I hope I&#039;ve met your requirements for a good answer. Have a nice day!</Content>
