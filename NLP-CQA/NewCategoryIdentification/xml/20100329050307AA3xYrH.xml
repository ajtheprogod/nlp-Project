  <Question id="20100329050307AA3xYrH" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is Lockerz losing members?</Subject>
    <Content>I am asking this because Lockerz has quadrupled(x4) their prices recently. Are people still keeping faith in Lockerz or are they leaving? TEN POINTS for best answer!

            <Content>I pretty much gave up, kinda sad, the prices are too much for me. I&#039;m doing the login and daily&#039;s, thats all. Don&#039;t even bother to watch the videos. I just switched to swagbucks, easier by far. Theres a refer link in my profile if your interested. Unless they get new ways to earn ptz, they&#039;ll lose all their members except for the Z-list ones. TRY TO MAKE ADVERTISING MONEY OFF THAT, LOCKERZ</Content>

            <Content>The first 3 months of lockerz was a trial period. Prices were so low as a &quot;thank you to the first members&quot;. Now that there are more and more people joining they believe it is nessesary to up their prices to reduce competition. However, as a blog post by lockerz a few days ago they also said while although prices are 4x now they will also be comming out with more ways to earn points besides the 4 points daily.</Content>
