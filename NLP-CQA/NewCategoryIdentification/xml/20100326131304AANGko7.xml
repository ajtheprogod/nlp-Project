    <Subject>Why can&#039;t I connect to the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>Hey guys it always starts connecting etc and then it only gets to local internet connection and wont go any further. This has only started happening after I went onto wireless network setup wizard and setup a new wireless network to the same SSID as the one I already had, now it always says it can connect to it but then cant connect to the internet and is only local connectivity. We are running wi fi and a WEP key but I dont know what it is :P I dont know how to reconnect please help me I really need to to be able to talk to my parents :(
