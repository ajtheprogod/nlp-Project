    <Subject>Help please! My internet keeps disconnecting even though it has full bars?</Subject>
    <Content>My Windows Vista laptop keeps dropping its internet connection every 30 seconds (Exactly every 30 seconds, I have to disconnect from the internet, then reconnect, then have it go out again 30 seconds later.) I&#039;ve virus scanned it over five times today, but the internet still won&#039;t stop dropping. I know it is not a signal problem, because my internet has full bars when it&#039;s connected. This is beginning to become a major annoyance, it&#039;s nonstop internet dropping. The connection isn&#039;t dropping on any computer but this one, which apparently doesn&#039;t have a virus. Help please?!?

    <ChosenAnswer>I solved a similar problem on my machine. Hope this helps.

I have separate ADSL modem and wireless router. I noticed that by default both of their IP addresses were &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;. I thought this would create conflict situation. So, I changed the IP address of my wireless router to something different (eg: 192.168.1.20). You can do so by logging on to your router. And simply this solved my problem.
