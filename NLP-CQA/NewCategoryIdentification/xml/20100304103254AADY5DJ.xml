    <ChosenAnswer>Here is what you want to do:
1. Install Firefox browser:
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html
2. Install adblock plus(open link in firefox):
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865
3. select easylist and then ok.

Done, 99% ads gone and for free


Please select the best answer, kinda sucks to give a good answer and have it go to a vote where people just end up voting for themselves.

Works just fine for me, do you have the latest update?
Also are you talking about the page they send you to when you have viewed a few pages? You can&#039;t get around being sent to that page. It would normally have a big advertisement on it but ad block plus does block that.

Also adblock plus removes the advertisement from the top of the page.  (i have tested it on deviant art)

You can also go into your addons menu, go to the options of adblock plus and then go to filters and then go update all subscriptions

Do you have Deviant art under the &quot;My exception rules&quot;?

What lists are you subscribed to?


I can assure you that it does work on that site and there must be a problem with your configuration. If all else fails try uninstalling and reinstalling adblock.</ChosenAnswer>
