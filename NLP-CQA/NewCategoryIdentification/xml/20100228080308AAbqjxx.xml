  <Question id="20100228080308AAbqjxx" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there an easy way to make money online?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m not looking to get rich or anything. I just want to know if there is an actual somewhat easy way to make at least some money online with relatively low effort. Please no pyramid scams or referral services or any of that B.S. Oh and also none of those schemes that demands money up front to start and then does nothing for you. So is there an actual way to get at least some money?

            <Content>Become a spammer. You&#039;ll make plenty of money without having to spend any at all.

Though if anyone finds out where you live, they&#039;ll come to your house and kill you, if not arrest you first.</Content>

            <Content>Eh, i hate the survey sites, so i use moola.com. They give you a free penny, and you can play games and make more money! you can also use their search engine, and about every ten searches you get 5-20 cents. I have been working at it for about two weeks and i have 1.70, but im really bad at the games. Hope it helps!</Content>

            <Content>Survey sites = like $1 per hour haha.

I laugh at people who say its not possible. They just don&#039;t have any experience with Internet marketing. Start off with a blog, put Google ads on it and you will be making small amounts, lets say $1 per day with traffic coming from Google. Now, if you can make a blog in 20 minutes, lets say you make 3 a day, thats 1 hour per day. So every day you grow by $3/day. On your 100th day, you will make $300/day. This is the easiest way to go but there are literally 1000s of ways to make money online. Hope I helped!</Content>

            <Content>Swagbucks. Totally legit. Ive made way over $50 in amazon.com gift cards. The site is just like google and ask.com combined. The way it works is randomly searching during the day you have a chance to win a swagbuck. Which is good to use in the swagstore. The swagstore has many electronics, gift cards, music, and much more. Try it out- Please use my referral link    http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>If you want money, you can take online surveys. These surveys can pay out $0.25 - $1.30 dollars per completion. Trust me - if you&#039;re new to online money making, that is A LOT of money in your pocket. Just go to http://gptcashcow.com/members/register.php?ref=xXBludnmunyXx (please use full link - it helps me a lot). Then, start taking surveys and earn up to $1.30!

If you don&#039;t believe me that you gain so much money, look at the math:

10 surveys in daily x $1.30 per survey = $13.00

$13.00 earned daily x 7 days in a week = $91.00

$91.00 earned weekly x 4 weeks in a month = $364.00

$364.00 earned monthly x 12 months in a year = $4368.00

And since there is no limit to how many surveys you take, you can keep taking them and taking them to earn more and more! These surveys are the easiest I have ever earned. In one day I earned $20.00, and I used that to pay for some online fun like MMORPG memberships. But you can also pay bills, rent, or anything else with it!

            <Content>There are many ways to earn some extra cash online.  One of the simplest and rewarding ways to do so is by completing surveys online.  There are several reliable sites that offer these services.  Treasure Trooper and Cash Crate are two of them.  Typically, these sites pay about a dollar for each survey you complete.  You may think that&#039;s not a lot of money, but trust me, it&#039;ll add up to a considerable amount.

            <Content>Agreed, there is no easy way to make money. There are shortcuts, but you pay for those, and then you&#039;ve got to be ready to work.

 It takes commitment and work.  Unless you just want to throw up a blog and monetize it, otherwise, writing articles, creating squidoo pages, hubpages, recommending products, these are all ways to make money online.</Content>

The only three things that have worked for me:

1) GPTHQ (the best free GPT site I&#039;ve ever used)

2) eBay (the fees are a bit much but still good)

3) Google Adsense (if you have a blog or website with some OK traffic)

Hope these help; links in source :)</Content>
