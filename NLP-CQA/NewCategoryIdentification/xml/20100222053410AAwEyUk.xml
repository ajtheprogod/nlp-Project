            <Content>It gives unlimited(free browsing and downloading) internet for 30 days without any FUP.And if you are lucky you might even get to download at 3G speeds for this small amount.
I just want to know if anyone has successfully recharge with it since I was previusly using the 230 STV and then a few days back the 230 STV just stop working before its 30 days period and I was charge for downloading from main account.
Later I recharge with 274 STV (since the 230 STV has now been replace with 274 STV) BUT UNLUCKILY IT gave some problems.</Content>
