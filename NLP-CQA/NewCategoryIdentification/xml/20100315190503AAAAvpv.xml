  <Question id="20100315190503AAAAvpv" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why am I not signed in to certain websites after clicking &#039;remember me&#039;?</Subject>
    <Content>It&#039;s kind of hard to explain.. But, like I click &#039;remember me&#039; or &#039;stay signed in&#039; And every time I exit out, I have to keep reentering my user name/password etc..

ALSO, why doesn&#039;t my computer save my previously typed in websites in my browser? [I use Mozilla Firefox and have Windows XP]

Thanks again.

            <Content>You must allow cookies in your browser....and don&#039;t delete them.

It is cookies that allow your computer to &quot;&#039;remember me&#039; and &#039;stay signed in&#039;.</Content>
