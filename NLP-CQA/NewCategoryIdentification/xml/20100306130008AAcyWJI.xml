    <ChosenAnswer>Yes, but the seller may hesitate to sell to someone who created an account minutes earlier.

Paypal will not be able to &quot;verify&quot; your account on short notice like that, either. They contact the bank to find out if the info matches.

It would be better to have a friend with an established account do it for you.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Check with Paypal website and see what their requirements are. Usually, they need a Bank Account verified, to use, so that will take some time before they get it approved. 

But like I said, check directly with them.</Content>
