            <Content>Iam not sure that the question is correct .
Iam confused .

But the right answer to your question is : 


Well , To browse internet on your pc with your iphone 3 G . first you iphone should have GPRS enabled and you should be able to connect to the internet on your mobile phone .

If you are able to browse internet on your mobile phone . Then connect your iphone to your pc via usb cable ,(before that install the iphone software on your pc ) and connect internet on your iphone . you can browse internet on your pc as well .
But its very very slow ... its around 10 or 12 kbps 

All the best 
But better to connect your pc with wired or wireless network</Content>
