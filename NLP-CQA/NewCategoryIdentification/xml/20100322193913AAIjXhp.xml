    <ChosenAnswer>its called: high latency issues. or possibly to much bandwith going through that router, i had the same problem, and from my expierence, i went and bought a new one. guess what? no more disconnections, at all, unless i unplugged the router (lol) but basically you need a new router, no joke. it also might be because your router doesnt recognize the other computer connected, and disconnects frequently.</ChosenAnswer>
