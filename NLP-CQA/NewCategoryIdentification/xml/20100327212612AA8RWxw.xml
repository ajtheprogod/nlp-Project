            <Content>Its very cheaper in india as compared to other countries. The best is BSNL broadband. First of all, You should get landline connection from BSNL, then apply for broadband connection.Unlimited connection would cost you 750?- Rs per month. Speed is less , as good as 1mbps. but its better for video watching too. Just visit www.bsnl.co.in</Content>

            <Content>Yes its a harsh reality that a country which is self proclaimed IT superpower doesn&#039;t have inexpensive or affordable internet for majority of its population. But you can get MTNL or BSNL connection. Latest MTNL offer is 512 kbps for 649 Rs. but you can&#039;t trust their services like every other govt. service because there is problem of frequent disconnection but ya its still better than private companies&#039; services because they charge you much more for the same access speed and sometimes the actual speed is not provided.</Content>
