    <ChosenAnswer>What you have asked here can&#039;t be certain. If you are looking at opening a chat room or site like face book think how much space a user has and what each pic/vid/what ever each person should have. Like googlemail, this constantly is expanding its users space and capacity of what can be stored. I would reckon around 100gb for a good size that&#039;s 10mb each person. But for you to set the web up around 3gb depending whats going on the page</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It&#039;s not possible to give a definite answer, but you shouldn&#039;t buy more space than is needed. When you are reaching the limit, add another few gigabytes into the server or upgrade your hosting plan.

I can say, no shared hosting account will allow that many users posting content, so either a dedicated server or VPS will be needed.</Content>
