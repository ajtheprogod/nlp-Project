    <Subject>Lockerz Fraud Emails?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok, so I just found out that making Lockerz emails yourself and inviting them to it just to get PTZ is against the Terms of Use. But i already made like...30-40 yahoo emails from the same computer. And it&#039;s pretty obvious they&#039;re fake, because the names are like &quot;akjsdgalskdjf&quot; or something similar on all of them, and the zip and pass on the accounts are all the same, and of course i never go on them, so they&#039;re not active accounts. I haven&#039;t gotten banned or anything yet, but when i redeem my prize is it possible for them to find out that I did this and deny me?

    <ChosenAnswer>i did the same thing! ok so i made aloottt of emails and they sent out this notice that said if u have been cheating then send an email to amnesty@lockerz.com and admit it and we wont delete your account. and i did that i sent the email and they just took the fraud ptz away and gave me another chance. so i suggest doing that or stopping because you wont get anywhere. i made over 300 ptz with fake emails and i got every one taken. i have 3000 now but they are legitimate. it takes time but its worth it belive meee. =]</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I would assume they have policies and trackers in place to nab folks who try to game the system.</Content>
