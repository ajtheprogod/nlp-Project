    <Subject>registering for myyearbook.com?</Subject>
    <Content>okay so does anyone have a myyearbook? its another social networking site. well I went to sign up for one and i am over the age requirement, but it says &quot;sorry, based on the information you provided, you are not eligible to register for myyearbook.com at this time&quot; all of my information is the truth and it says you have to be at least 13 years of age, I&#039;m over 13. so I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m doing something wrong. does anyone know what the problem could be? or how to contact them to ask them? 
thanks!
