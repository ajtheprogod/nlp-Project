  <Question id="20100307231016AA4V3jA" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What are some actual online payday loan places?</Subject>
    <Content>I am just wondering what are some websites to actual payday loan places not third party searchers for lenders. Preferably some reasonably easy ones. I am trying to help a friend of mine get some money because he wants to get his life on track and get a job but his car is broken down and there isnt any business in walking distance or any public transportation because he lives in such a small town. Or if anyone knows an organization who can help someone in that situation. Thanks!
