    <ChosenAnswer>You should receive an email from Amazon with a link to click to verify your email address. If you haven&#039;t received the email, check your spam folder. If it&#039;s not in there, go to Amazon, look under account settings, find where you can change your email address. If you gave them the wrong address, change it and they&#039;ll resend the verification email. If they have the right address it will be marked unverified and there should be a link to resend the verification email.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>usually u will receive a mail abt the product which u purchased, this will linked with a verfication mail... just clik that link to verify so simple, nothing to worry as well, if the server is down it might take 2-4hrs to receive the mail :)</Content>
