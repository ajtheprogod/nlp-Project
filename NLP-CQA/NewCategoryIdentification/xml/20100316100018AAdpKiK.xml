    <ChosenAnswer>Did you go to use skin and click &quot;featured&quot;? If you did its being reviewed by staff that control bebo to see if its appropriate that&#039;s why they don&#039;t appear when you search for it.....but you&#039;ll be waiting a while and just so you know for like every 500 skins maybe 5 will be accepted...why its not in your module I dont know....sorry.  :(</ChosenAnswer>
