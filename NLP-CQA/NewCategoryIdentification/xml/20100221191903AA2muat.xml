            <Content>I&#039;m able to navigate around and select a movie. It wants me to load Adobe Flash Player 10 at that point, but I don&#039;t see any problems with the website. FWIW, I have Windows XP.

Try clearing out your cookies and temporary Internet files cache, then try Hulu again.</Content>
