    <ChosenAnswer>Well, DVD regions are something I&#039;m not sure you understand. Each &quot;region&quot; is a market. There are seven of them: North America, Latin America, Japan, Europe, etc. Manufacturers put regions on DVD&#039;s to make it harder for people to ship DVD&#039;s from one region to another... so they can sell a DVD cheaper in India and more expensive in Europe or the US. 

The best way to get buyers attention is Buy It Nows (most people don&#039;t want to wait a week for an auction to end to save $2 on a DVD) and clever utilization of the title. You get 55 characters on your title. You have to zoom in on things people might be searching for. Like movie&#039;s title and big stars in it.</ChosenAnswer>
