    <ChosenAnswer>No theres not and if you do you will be deactivated. Lockerz is pretty much a scam. Tho it is possible to win. People have done it.

But i suggest you try out Swagbucks. Swagbucks is legit and always have prizes in stock. You win points by searching the web. Its random but easy. Ive made of $100 in amazon and $25 in Paypal. Theres other ways of winning such as swagcodes. Check out the facebook wall.
