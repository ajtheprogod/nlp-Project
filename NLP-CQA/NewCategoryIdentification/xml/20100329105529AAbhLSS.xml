    <ChosenAnswer>Hi!

Do a search for Moz Backup. I use it all the time, it will make a back up of all your setting, bookmarks, passwords, etc. I believe it also gets your addons, but I&#039;m not 100% sure. I&#039;ve used it numerous times and I don&#039;t remember having to go out and reinstall all my addons. It&#039;s a great program and has saved me tons of time when switching to a new computer. Just create a back up of Firefox, then install Firefox on the new computer and run Moz Backup and choose the restore option, it also does the same thing for Thunderbird. Great software!

Hope this helps
Good Luck!
