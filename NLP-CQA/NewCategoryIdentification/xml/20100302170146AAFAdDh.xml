  <Question id="20100302170146AAFAdDh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why is z-index working in Firefox and Chrome but not in IE?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a DIV that &quot;drops down&quot; when you click on a link using JavaScript. It works exactly as it is supposed to in Firefox and Chrome. In IE, the DIV displays beneath the elements after it in the markup.

The Z-index is set to 10000...

This is the URL
http://www.calientetropics.com/palm-springs-pool.php
Click on the navigation link that says &quot;Site Search&quot; and notice the white box that appears beneath it.

Any suggestions?
***I haven&#039;t tried in Safari or Opera because I don&#039;t have those browsers installed on my work comp, so would also be great if someone could let me know how it looks in them.

    <ChosenAnswer>OK listen up everyone! Micro$oft IE is a piece of Sh!t, but people still use it, so developers have to adapt. We don&#039;t like it and IE users don&#039;t ether because most website look like when you are using IE. Why does Micro$ft do it to us? Because they can!!! Why don&#039;t they just adopt Web-Kit (like everyone else) I don&#039;t know. They have a fully functional IE with web-kit. But they won&#039;t release it. IE 9 lets hope. As for the answer to your question try this http://brenelz.com/blog/squish-the-internet-explorer-z-index-bug/ I apologize for my rant.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I looked at your source.

Have you tried just changing the positioning to relative and then positioning it with a relative position with your JS call?  I see you are using absolute positioning and this might cause an issue with IE even though you are Z indexing it.</Content>

            <Content>Watch out with the javascript in Opera. The word on th street (okay, maybe not the street, the forums) is that they&#039;re gonna be using a different engine than they have in the past. It should be a non-issue,,but you never know.

I don&#039;t have the technical knwledge of javascript to help you with your problem, but I just thought I&#039;d give you the heads-up.
