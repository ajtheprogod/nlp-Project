    <Subject>Really Bad Virus?? Help?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay my parents computer has a really bad virus. It won&#039;t let them get into any files on their computer and this little box keeps popping up saying that it has a virus on the computer and it will open their internet to a website for an anti-virus. And whenever they try to go online it will bring them to a anti-virus site and won&#039;t let them look up anything else but that. They do have Avast Anti-Virus but the virus has taken over it so it stopped working. How can i get rid of the virus? Thanks!

Well it will keep saying that there is a Virus,Malware, and Spyware on the computer. We got our computer into safe mode and it seems to be working now but we can&#039;t get onto the internet. I did click on the safe mode with the internet. So i don&#039;t know why it won&#039;t let us. I will keep trying to find out what it is. But will avast scan the whole computer in safe mode?

            <Content>HEADS UP: Do not take it to Geek Squad. What you&#039;ll probably have to do is get a 100GB drive, plug it into your computer, and get your information off of it. Then you&#039;ll have to reformat. Go to a local computer guy or whatever and ask him about it. Hopefully he can fix it. I know viruses are a big hassle, but don&#039;t panic and spend 300 dollars.</Content>
