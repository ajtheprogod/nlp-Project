    <ChosenAnswer>Hello,

There is a Second Life for teen members only, you can signup at the link in my Source section of this answer and then you just need to download Second Life and login like you normally would for the adult Second Life, but instead it will take you to the Teen worlds. I&#039;ve played Second Life before and I used to go on it every day, I know these things and that&#039;s why I helped you out with this!

It&#039;s just like signing up for the adult one, but instead use your real information and it will take you to the Teen worlds in-game.</Reference>
