    <Subject>MLIA account........?</Subject>
    <Content>okay so, i signed up for an MLIA account last night while on mobile web. but when i tried to log in, it wouldnt let me.i gave up, thinking it was just mobile web being dumb.
today, i returned to the site while on my laptop. i tried to log in, but it told me my account was inactive. i thought maybe the registering hadn&#039;t worked from my phone, so i tried to make a new account. it worked, and told me that an activation email had been sent. i checked my email- nothing was there. i check the spam&amp;trash folders as well. i tried logging in but it still told me it was inactive. so.... now what? sorry if that was confusing.
i just want to be able to log in cause they wont let me submit a story right now until i have an account :(
thank youuu

    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;ve done the same thing recently. I have a Hotmail account for my personal email, and I tried using that; once on the phone, and then on my laptop when I never received my confirmation email, but I still never got one. I own a Droid (on Verizon&#039;s network) and for that you need a Gmail account, so on my computer I registered with my Gmail, and while I didn&#039;t receive it immediately, it did come. So, now I&#039;m registered and active :) I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll work the same way for you, but that&#039;s how I did it.</ChosenAnswer>
