    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s not illegal or anything, although I&#039;m sure it&#039;s frowned upon. :)  I once sold something where they asked me to ship to a UPS store in Niagara so they could just drive down and pick it up and avoid duties, taxes, etc. 

I would just change it when you print the shipping label.</ChosenAnswer>
