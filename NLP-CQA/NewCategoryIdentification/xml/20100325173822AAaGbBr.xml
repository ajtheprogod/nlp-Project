    <Subject>Why do Cell phone providers have a 5gb cap on laptop data?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok, this is a serious question about wireless internet service. I want to know why almost all companies put a 5gb cap on laptop data. &quot;Because they&#039;re greedy&quot; and &quot;They&#039;re dumb&quot; won&#039;t cut it. I want to know if it ACTUALLY costs them more money to provide service if a customer uses more data. Other than a nominal server energy cost, does it really cost THEM more, or is it just a clever money-making tactic? I know putting up the physical tower-network is anything but cheap, but really? My example question is &quot;Does it cost them more money to supply 10mb of data than 1mb?&quot; If so, how much more? I want to have a deeper understanding of how things work. Any real help will be appreciated.&quot;

    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;m not sure exactly how much, but of course it costs more to send out more. Hence why things like video messages are more than picture messages if you don&#039;t have a plan. This is also why some ISP&#039;s have a bandwidth cap.</ChosenAnswer>
