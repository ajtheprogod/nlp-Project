  <Question id="20100312022657AA03fgB" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Website Hybrid Idea Assistance Please.?</Subject>
    <Content>I have recently made a website that links to tv series and movies online. I was curious if it would be wise to make it a hybrid website linking to videos and being a blog.

Please tell me your thoughts on this, or if you have any other things i can add to this website for hybrid potential.

Thank you.

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi,

First let me address the nature of your site. You said that your site links to tv series and movies online. Do you mean that your site supports streaming video? If you&#039;re streaming copyrighted material you could get shut down fairly quick although a lot of sites do this to get ad revenue- I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s why you&#039;re doing it. If YouTube could show TV shows and Movies don&#039;t you think they would do it? I would recommend only featuring amateur or open material if you expect your site to last.

As for your real question. People generally want to watch videos when they go to a video site, not blog about them but you could do what YouTube already does and make room for comments below the video. If you&#039;re really set on blogging then you could set up links by the videos that lead to blog sites specifically about the video, you could even make some decent click-through revenue by this and not to mention cross promotion. You could also have a separate blog just for your site, which could help drive more traffic to your site. You&#039;re dealing in a very competitive market so you really need something that gives you a special advantage. I think you&#039;re definitely thinking about innovation, I just don&#039;t think blogging is going to help you drive a lot of traffic. I&#039;d recommend partnering with Google Adsense if you haven&#039;t already and hooking your site up with some popular social networking sites like facebook and twitter.

That&#039;s the best advice I have for you, good luck.</ChosenAnswer>
