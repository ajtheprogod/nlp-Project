            <Content>it depends on what kind of data plan you have.  If you have an unlimited data plan for it, then no.
I would like to point out though, that you really need to be careful about that.  There has been so many people having issues with their iphones, having unlimited plans, and getting $1800+ bills because even though they were in Miami, AT&amp;T said they were roaming and the international rates applied.</Content>
