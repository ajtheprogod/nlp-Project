    <ChosenAnswer>Since Firefox has had a few updates recently some things have stopped working. I know that some people have has persona issues like this and I also know there have been issues with HP printer stuff. Just use a different theme and wait for a Firefox update that fixes the issue. That&#039;s all you can do.</ChosenAnswer>
