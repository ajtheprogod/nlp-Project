    <ChosenAnswer>If you are on limited internet then that could cause this.

Apart from that, check the port is still forwarded properly and that the torrent is still well seeded.

You should also do a full scan for virus and malware.

Could also be the your isp is blocking p2p or just thorttling traffic at certain times of day.

            <Content>Your download quota has run out. You need to wait for several days or weeks before your download quota replenishes. Make sure you know how much download quota you have before you download so much stuff.</Content>
