  <Question id="20100226213523AAdyoY0" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Internet Disconnection problems.?</Subject>
    <Content>Yahoo Instant Messenger, Yonno [Firefox add-on], any internet browser that isn&#039;t Firefox, every MMO I have on my computer, and programs I want to download that need internet connection are not working because for some reason they believe my internet is disconnected, even though it&#039;s not. The only thing that isn&#039;t fooled by this is Firefox. I posted this question a few times in other places without getting much help. Does anyone know how to fix this?
According to my friend, it&#039;s a Windows 7 network glitch. Still don&#039;t know how to fix it though.
