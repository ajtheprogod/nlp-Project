    <ChosenAnswer>Because, there are a lot of websites on the internet that offer some services in exchange for your personal information. Since you never actually read the License Agreement, you might have overlooked that they have permission to sell your private information to companies like mylife.com.
When a site requires you to fill up personal information, check the License Agreement and the website credentials first.</ChosenAnswer>
