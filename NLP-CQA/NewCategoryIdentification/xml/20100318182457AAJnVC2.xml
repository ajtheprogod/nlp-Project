  <Question id="20100318182457AAJnVC2" type="Answered">
    <Subject>how do i get more people to check out my blog?</Subject>
    <Content>i am new to blogging, and am really enjoying writing in my blog, but no one ever looks at it. i read somewhere that it helps to posts comments on other peoples blogs, so i tried doing that but it hasn&#039;t really worked. i would really like to get into following a few blogs and having them follow mine back. my blog is about my life, but i try to keep it interesting, and i am interested in reading blogs similar to mine. it seems like lots of bloggers do this, but i cant figure out how to get into it. have i just not been blogging for long enough? does it come with time? or am i doing something wrong?

btw my blog is openunatedgirl.wordpress.com

    <ChosenAnswer>There are countless ways of building traffic to your blog, but they all take work.  Some of these include:   

Link-building
Correct SEO/Keyword usage
Forums
Social Networking
RSS feed
Great Content(very important to search engines)

One very significant similarity with bloggers that write about their own life is that they are outstanding netwriters.  Now don&#039;t get me wrong, you do write well, but is it good enough to keep people coming back?  So much of blog traffic is people who subscribe and follow the author consistently.

That said, you have to also make sure and update your blog at a steady pace.  It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a couple times a day, once a day, or once a week, it just has to be consistent.  Your readers want to know that they can check your blog at a certain time and probably find a new post.  If they don&#039;t find one, their &quot;anticipation bubble&quot; might have popped.  

There are many, many ways to increase traffic to your blog, I hope these suggestions have helped answer your question :)  Good Luck!



P.S. I love the nothing &quot;capitalized look&quot;.  Just by doing that, you have created a environment of informality and casualness.</ChosenAnswer>
