  <Question id="20100225201630AAAiqdh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What are the pros and cons of Internet Explorer 8?</Subject>
    <Content>I accidently upgraded from Internet Explorer 7 to Internet Explorer 8.

It says its faster, but I am more worried about brower security. Should I go back to IE 7? I also have Mozilla Firefox and Safari installed, but I don&#039;t use them as much because I am just more used to Windows Internet Explorer.

    <ChosenAnswer>I suggest you stick with IE8. IE8 is faster and safer than IE 7. It is also compatible with more sites than any other browser. If you are concerned with the way IE 8 will interact with sites you are visiting, you should check out Compatibility Mode which allows you to view sites as they would appear in IE 6 or IE 7, with the added security and speed of IE 8. Here&#039;s some more information: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/02/16/just-the-facts-recap-of-compatibility-view.aspx

Other cool new features are web-slices and accelerators.
