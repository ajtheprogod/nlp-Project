  <Question id="20100318113302AAbEP8I" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What besides Facebook?</Subject>
    <Content>I am sick of facebook all the issues - I am bored at facebook. Is there something else on the web that is a bit more interesting to do? Any suggestions?
O and My Space, Bebo etc all the other social site is almost the same as facebook just as pointless!!
Another thing when I was a teenager there weren&#039;t something like My Space even, Facebook is just a drag!!
