    <ChosenAnswer>Anthrocon is the world&#039;s largest Furry (fans of anthropomorphic animals) convention, held in Pittsburgh, PA on June 24-27, 2010. I&#039;m looking forward to attending again this year.

I&#039;ve been going to Anthrocon every year since it started way back in 1997. At first, I didn&#039;t know anyone there either and have always been kind of shy myself, but over the years I&#039;ve gotten over that and made a lot of friends. A good way to meet people is to volunteer and help out at the convention... that&#039;s what I did when I started (carrying supplies and helping assemble the art show). Eventually I volunteered so much they put me on staff. -:)  You can meet a wide variety of people and get a good sense of the inner workings of the convention while volunteering. 

Or, if you want to meet new folks in a relaxed atmosphere, there are some social events like the gaming track or Thursday night social mixer or dances in the evenings. 

I don&#039;t really have a wander-around group at Anthrocon because it&#039;s a working convention for me, I have to run around escorting the media and such. It&#039;s still a lot of fun though!</ChosenAnswer>
