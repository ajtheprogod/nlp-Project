    <Subject>Craigslist &quot;it&#039;s not ok...&quot; question?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m looking at apartment listings, preparing for a July 1 move.  In the city I&#039;m searching, there are very few Craigslist listings for July 1, but many for June 1 and earlier.  I thought it would be potentially helpful for me to contact some of the people/organizations listing properties for rent, to see if they know if they will have any July openings, but I&#039;m worried about violating the &quot;it&#039;s NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests&quot; statement at the bottom of nearly every page.  

Would my request qualify as &quot;other commercial interests?&quot;  

Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>No, you would be contacting them to potentially give them business. The do not contact would be if you were soliciting them for your own commercial interests.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If you&#039;re trying to sell things over the phone, don&#039;t call.
If you&#039;re calling just to advertise business, don&#039;t call.

If your call actually pertains to the ad, then call.</Content>
