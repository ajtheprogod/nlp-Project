    <ChosenAnswer>Yes contact them first &amp; if they fail to refund or send a replacement within a reasonable timeframe, open a INR dispute through paypal &amp; escalate to a cliam. You only have 45 days from the date that you paid to do this so keep on eye on the time</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If it has been 25 days you need to file a dispute with Paypal and E-bay. I think pay-pal has a limit for 30 days after the purchase. If you don&#039;t dispute it in 30 days, you are screwed I am pretty sure. You should of contacted the person a while ago, dispute is last action you should take, but in your case it is almost to late, so you should resort to that.</Content>
