    <ChosenAnswer>You don&#039;t need to CHANGE to Firefox 3.6.  Simply download it and keep IE8 as your default browser.  If you find later that you like Firefox better, you can change it to your default browser.

Firefox may help some with browsing speeds, but more than likely you have other things that you need to look at.  Defragging your hard drive, clearing your browser cache, removing spyware, removing viruses, and adding more memory will benefit you as well.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>IE is a huge security hole of death.  You should always use a alternative browser.  Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari any one of those is far better then IE.  If you don&#039;t have an AV or Adware scanner chances are you&#039;ve got a ton of bad things on your computer through using IE slowing it down.  So yes your first step is installing Firefox or any of the others I listed http://www.getfirefox.com .  Then install a AV such as Avira http://www.free-av.com and let that scan your computer.  Then install a Spyware scanner such as Malware Bytes http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html .  That should make your computer run far better.</Content>
