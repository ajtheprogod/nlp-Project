  <Question id="20100226152403AAAisxs" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Help - Moderator on Discussion Forum Blocking My Computer?</Subject>
    <Content>I had an account with a discussion forum. I opened a second account for separate issues in the forum. Both my accounts are now banned by the moderator for having more than one account. How did they know I opened a second account - I opened it with a separate email address and screen name? I want to get a new account but the sign in page is automatically locked. Is there something I can change in my computer or internet settings to open another account?
