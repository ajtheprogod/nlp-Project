    <Subject>Question about megavideo. Please help.?</Subject>
    <Content>Megavideo&#039;s limit is supposed to be 72 mins but sometimes after just about 10 mins the video stops and it tells me that I&#039;ve reached te 72 mins limit.  Does this happen to someone else? And is there a way that I can avoid the limit?

    <ChosenAnswer>the limit applies to all computers on your network, so if you have a family member in the house also watching megavideo that day or someone stealing your wifi, it will take away from your time limit.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I think it&#039;s intentional, so you will want to pay to watch a movie all the way through...The only way around this is to pay for the service.</Content>
