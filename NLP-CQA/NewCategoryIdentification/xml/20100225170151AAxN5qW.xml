  <Question id="20100225170151AAxN5qW" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Which internet provider(s) have the best reviews?</Subject>
    <Content>I was thinking Earthlink but I recently saw some negative things about it. I&#039;m taking online college for the first 2 years so I need a service with high speed and decent protection. Windstream&#039;s not all that good ( they charge lots more for less), and Cable One did the same thing. Please help

    <ChosenAnswer>Verizon is arguably the best internet provider, assuming they have fiber optic cables run in your area. Other than that, there&#039;s a company called Access4less in my are that provides only internet service (no e-mail or antivirus) for $10 a month and it&#039;s great for it&#039;s price.</ChosenAnswer>
