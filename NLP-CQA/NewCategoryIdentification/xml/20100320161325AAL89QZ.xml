    <ChosenAnswer>They are just saying that to scare you, you could well be a man pretending to be a girl for all they know.  Don&#039;t worry nothing bad will happen, just be more sensible in the future.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The good thing about your post is you&#039;re not asking how to &quot;unban&quot; yourself as so many American teens do.  You&#039;re obviously mature enough to understand that a site owner has the obvious right to exclude whomever he/she wishes.
Nothing we can do to help.  You simply have to wait and see whether the threat to contact rhe authorities was merely smething to scare you</Content>
