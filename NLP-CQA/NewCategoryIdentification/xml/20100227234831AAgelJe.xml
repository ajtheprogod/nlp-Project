    <Subject>Can&#039;t even find wireless networks.?</Subject>
    <Content>Alright.My iPhone, Xbox, and 3 other laptops can detect and connect wirelessly to my wireless modem. Yet one can&#039;t. I&#039;ve made sure the WLAN switch is on and indicated by a blue light. I&#039;ve even tried connecting with the ethernet cable directly to the modem but it still can&#039;t detect. Any ideas?

    <ChosenAnswer>Well you didn&#039;t state WHICH ONE... but i&#039;m going to assume the laptop .... lol  Any how, it&#039;s probably just the network controller is bad ( in other words your hardware adapter is bad if it&#039;s the Xbox or the Iphone ~ i believe thats low chance for those 2 ) 

In the laptop if i was correct, then it&#039;s a good chance that the Onboard Wifi is bad, so you may want to get a wireless internet card and try that, but first thing i would try is uninstalling the Networking drivers then reinstalling them.. 

Uninstalling Network device

In windows 7 or Vista Go to the Windows button ( formerly Start button ) Right click on &quot;computer&quot; click &quot;properties&quot; then on the left click &quot;device manager&quot;  ( might say manage devices ) Find the Networking group, and expand that. Find your Network cards or w/e and Uninstall that.. reboot then reinstall ~ then hope for the best~

If it IS your Xbox or Iphone... look into having the manafacturer take a look into it.</ChosenAnswer>
