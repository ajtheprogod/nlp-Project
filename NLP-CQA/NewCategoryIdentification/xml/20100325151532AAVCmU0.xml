  <Question id="20100325151532AAVCmU0" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why are all these websites not working?</Subject>
    <Content>in the past week something weird has happened on my computer.  Most of the websites that i&#039;ve gone to in the past along with others have stopped working.  When i try to go to them, either i gives me the &quot;internet can&#039;t display this page&quot; message or the format is all screwed up and pictures don&#039;t show up.  I thought my computer was just screwed up but when i went on my parent&#039;s computer, the same thing happened.  What&#039;s the problem? Is there something wrong with the connection? and if so how do i fix it?
thank you!

            <Content>Your internet speed is extremely slow.
Try to talk to your ISP - it&#039;s quite common that your internet service provoider gives you a much lower speed than what you&#039;re paying for. Just call them and it should be fixed within a few minutes - that&#039;s what happened to me :)</Content>
