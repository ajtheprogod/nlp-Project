  <Question id="20100328052358AAvsUiT" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Internet Explorer address bar won&#039;t give me lists of sites anymore unless I put the whole address?</Subject>
    <Content>I just want to put in a word and for  a search and get a list of sites like I used to.

And before you all start - I KNOW it&#039;s antiquated, I don&#039;t want to change it though and there&#039;s no need to be nasty to me....please just be kind and help? 

Thanks.
