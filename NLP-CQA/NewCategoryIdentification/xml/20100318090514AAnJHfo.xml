    <ChosenAnswer>I live in pennsylvania and only two companies provide to my area and our cheapest is comcast. It starts at like, 35 a month but after a couple of months, it like, doubles for some reason, but it is fast. However, I had AT&amp;T Internet before moving to PA and they are about 45 a month and it was really fast as well. Hope this helps.</ChosenAnswer>
