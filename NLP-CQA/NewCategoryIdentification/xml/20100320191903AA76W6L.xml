    <Subject>Ustream Instantly Crashes my browser?</Subject>
    <Content>So, I&#039;ve been trying to broadcast some game-play on Ustream for a while now, but every time I try, with any browser, Ustreams broadcaster instantly crashes it. I&#039;ve tried Google Chrome, Firefox, I think IE, but nothing&#039;s worked. Does anyone know why it does this, and if there&#039;s a way to fix it?

Thanks.
