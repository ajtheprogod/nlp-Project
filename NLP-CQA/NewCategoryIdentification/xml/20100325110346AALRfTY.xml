    <Subject>What internet browser allows you NOT to delete history?</Subject>
    <Content>I had Google Chrome, but I noticed you could still delete or be &quot;secret&quot; about the history with the &#039;incognito&quot; tool. So, I want that gone. 
What internet browser won&#039;t let you delete the history?
Or what is a good tool to make sure you can 100% see what a person is looking at.
thank you :)

            <Content>no browser stops that. however you can write scrips that stop users from having the option. you could write a script to back up all the history to another location for your review and i do believe checking logs in your router and DNS server will also do the trick</Content>
