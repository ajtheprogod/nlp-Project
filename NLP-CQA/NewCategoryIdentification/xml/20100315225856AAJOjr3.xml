    <Subject>Ebay, what to do when buyer is clueless?</Subject>
    <Content>~I have a buyer who bidded and paid about double what I expected for an item. The money is currently pending in my paypal account. 

~I have a feeling the buyer is going to email me any second and beg for a refund... However the item I was selling is time sensitive and loses value day after day which would result in me getting about half of what I was expecting to get if the &quot;clueless one&quot; did not bid on it....

~I clearly explained what I was selling and how it would be shipped on my ebay page.
30 dollar is what I should have received. But the buyer paid 80.

            <Content>Well what they bidded is there choice you could offer it to them cheaper. But if they bidded on that at that price then thats there problem. 

Don&#039;t worry about it

unless it was worth like 5 bucks and they paid like 500000000 for it.

hope this helps</Content>

            <Content>He paid, you should just send it right away.
Yes some people are clueless or maybe he just has pots of cash. Think yourself lucky. It could easily go the other way, you might have something good to sell and nobody bids at all. Or 99c. Win some, lose some.</Content>
