    <ChosenAnswer>Edit: The issue has been resolved but may still temporarily affect you locally. 

If you have made the temporary change I gave, I would suggest removing it and seeing if you can still connect to the site. (You may want to reboot to clear out any local caching.) 

The WHOIS registration on GoDaddy (the domain registrar) for the babblesex.com domain is cited below. It shows that the domain was renewed 15-Mar-2010. Using Kloth.Net&#039;s NSLOOKUP for babblesex.com returned the correct IP address -- 174.37.22.18. (server: localhost, Query: A (IP address))

Original answer:
The domain expired.

GoDaddy appears to have parked the domain. http://help.godaddy.com/article/608

Add these three lines temporarily to your hosts file under C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\

            <Content>Yeah, because the site isn&#039;t owned by anyone anymore. It&#039;s just a placeholder now. Shut up about it.</Content>
