    <ChosenAnswer>1.) Close your outlook by using the File &gt; Close option. Then Open Outlook backup.

2.) Perform the Send / Receive option only once and let it finish.

3.) Make sure you&#039;re not saving copies of the email on your server. Check this by going to Tools &gt; Account Settings. Highlighting the account and clicking the Change button. Then Clicking the More Settings button, clicking the Advanced tab, and unchecking Leave copies on the server checkbox.

4.) After checking that setting and the initial send and receive is complete, try it once more.

This should work.

You can turn the Leave copies setting back up, but if the problem returns, its obviously not syncing the times properly with your mail server and the option is useless.</ChosenAnswer>
