    <ChosenAnswer>Short answer: No.

Bluetooth is a technology used for short-range tethering of two compatible devices for streaming or exchanging data. Max range varies, but is typically ~30 feet/10 meters.

You would have to find an open wifi connection around your area (Your laptop needs an internal wifi card, or USB Wifi dongle), and connect that way. Your phone cannot help you in this situation.</ChosenAnswer>
