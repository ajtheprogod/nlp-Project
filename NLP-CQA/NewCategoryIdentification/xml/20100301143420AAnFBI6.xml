    <ChosenAnswer>Well MW2 has just 1 problem; IWnet. Check your NAT type at the game screen (the scrren after &quot;play game&quot; on MP, where you can choose &quot;Find Game&quot;, &quot;Private Match&quot; etc) and how to open it if it isn&#039;t open. Worked for me, but still depends on the host. Maybe she makes a better host than you and vice versa. Don&#039;t try parties if you see you both make a bad host, wait to join a game and invite, then wish you&#039;re on the same team. It&#039;s just IWnet and Activision...Patience and BC2 are the only cures (or moving to London and taking a 100.000.000.000.000 Gbps connection and a computer with a 10.000GB ram along with a 100.000.000 GB hard drive and a 16 GB graphics card. Just kiddin&#039;, of course!No really it is a way.Can&#039;t decide)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>There are many things that could be screwing with your internet connection, and a few solutions you could try.


First Thing:

Problem: ISP Sucks

Description: Your friends ISP may suck. One of the worst Internet Service Providers rhymes with Cell and starts with a B. I cant legally say who but I think you have the point.

Solution: Theres not much you can do, except switch to a faster plan or switch ISP.


Second Thing:

Problem: Xbox Live

Description: Some times people can not connect to certain people on live because of Host problems. Not much else to say other then live can be buggy. 

Solutions: Not to much can be done about this, and because you want Spec Ops you cant use a 3rd party to let you play. 


Third Thing:

Problem: MW2 Host Servers

Description: MW2 is an awesome game not doubt about it, however they sort of cheeped out on the servers. If you have noticed MW2 makes you run off 1 main host that is picked. If they quit a game thats when your game freezes and it says picking new host. If they would have made dedicated servers then you wouldn&#039;t have connection problems at all.

Solution: Yell at Infinity Ward and tell them to smarten up :P

Thats just about all I can think off, I hope I helped.

Best of Luck,
