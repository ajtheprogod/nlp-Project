    <Subject>Can somebody please invite me to Demonoid?</Subject>
    <Content>I have been waiting for it to open up so I can join but it is never open.  The only other option is that somebody has to invite you and you have to put in a code.

Thanks

    <ChosenAnswer>I think it&#039;s only open on the first day of each month. At least, that&#039;s how I got in, and they were inviting when I just happened to go on the site.

You can use isohunt too. In some ways, it&#039;s better.</ChosenAnswer>
