    <Subject>Is there a way to watch the Ghana Music Awards Festival from the USA?</Subject>
    <Content>Hey, I live in the USA but I am obsessed with Hiplife music in Ghana.  :)  I REALLY want to watch the Ghana Music Awards Festival on April 10, 2010 to see if my favorite performers win any (hopefully ALL) the five awards they&#039;ve been nominated for.  Is there ANY way to watch Ghana TV so I can see the show too???  THANKS.

    <ChosenAnswer>In order to receive Ghana TV, it must be transmitted on the other end...... I doubt they have an up link to a satellite. The other solution would be to stream it off the internet.  TV-online-channels.com would be one of many solutions, www.yourglobaltv.com › is another one
hope this  helps</ChosenAnswer>
