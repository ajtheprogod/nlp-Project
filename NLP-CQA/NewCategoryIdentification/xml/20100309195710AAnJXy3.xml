            <Content>they haven&#039;t given the date of the redemption yet. it will most likely be on the last day of march radness or the day after. this is what is says on the site:

March Radness Update:

Be sure you have your country selected in your settings. Otherwise, all your PTZ won&#039;t work to help your country win. Here are the rules:

1. Team US includes all members living in the 50 states. Members in all other countries, including Canada, are part of Team International.

2. March Radness takes place between March 8, 2010 at 6 PM Eastern and March 25, 2010 at 11:59 PM Eastern.

3. The winning team will have the most total PTZ, including PTZ for videos watched, PTZ for dailies, PTZ for logins, PTZ for accepted legitimate invites in the given time period. Zlisters still get double points for all activity.

4. The winning team -- and only the winning team -- will participate in March&#039;s redemption.

5. This redemption will happen in only one wave.

6. Members are only allowed to redeem one (1) item.

7. There will be no exchanges, no returns, no cancellations and no PTZ refunds on redeemed prizes.

8. Use of any bots, cheats or fraud will result in immediate order and membership cancellation.</Content>
