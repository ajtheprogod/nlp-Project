  <Question id="20100305101311AAKcLpr" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there any free hosting site like webs (once freewebs)?</Subject>
    <Content>I knew it as freewebs before, now it&#039;s called webs.

Anyways, is there any free hosting site like this? I&#039;m trying to manage a bunch of pages on one of my sites, but right now, it&#039;s really messy and confusing. I don&#039;t think I have the time to clean it up or anything.

So, is there any site relatively similar to webs? The only thing I&#039;m looking for is a site where I don&#039;t have to use one of their template and you can upload images (or just files in general, because I need to upload my layouts). If possible, ad-free.

Then again, I think webs is the best free hosting site there is. . . Or out of what I&#039;ve seen.

So, y!A, do you know any sites like webs?

            <Content>Free web hosting companies come with ad banners which can be quite annoying to your users. Rather, you can try cheap and economical web hosting. I&#039;d recommend you iPage. When you register a domain name you usually require a web hosting. iPage brings you a convenience. You can now book an iPage free domain registration great with your web hosting package.
