    <ChosenAnswer>Try opening up the web site on a different computer then downloading the program on that computer, then saving the file to a USB and returning to your computer and installing it. Seeing as you&#039;ve had virus&#039;s on your computer it could be possible that a virus has infected one of your system framework files causing you to not be able to access some things online.

Since you need this download right away I would download it on a friends computer and save the file to a USB and then later you can worry about why your computer isn&#039;t working right.</ChosenAnswer>

C:\Windows\System32|Drivers\etc

and do a search or any of those site&#039;s

If anything relates to that site it will show up, then you can just delete them...
