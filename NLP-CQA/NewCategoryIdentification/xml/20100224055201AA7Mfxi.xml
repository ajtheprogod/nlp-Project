    <ChosenAnswer>1) Look carefully at the sellers history. Look at their previous sales and not just purchases (anyone can build good feedback buying cheap goods!)

2) Look how long they have been registered with e-bay. (Beware newby&#039;s selling expensive goods at a knock down price.)

3) What is the true market value of the item (If it looks to good to be true, it probably isn&#039;t true!)

4) Don&#039;t put any  faith in E-bays resolution centre. Experience has taught me they are little or no help when things go wrong, despite what they promise on the website. 

5) Pay by credit card via Paypal. Paypal means you are not giving your seller your card details so helps reduce fraud. The credit card also gives you more consumer rights. 

6) Never buy anything on e-bay with money you can&#039;t afford to loose. That way if it all goes wrong you aren&#039;t heart broken.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Check their history as a seller and see what people have said about their previous sales. If they&#039;re a new seller be wary and ask questions.</Content>

            <Content>Well that&#039;s not exactly a great deal if it&#039;s one of the older Blackberrys. As someone else has mentioned, they&#039;re about that price in shops these days.</Content>
