    <ChosenAnswer>&quot;They spelled color as &quot;colour&quot;. &quot;
That isn&#039;t necessarily wrong, colour is the normal spelling in British English.

&quot;Should i trust this site?&quot;
Without more information I couldn&#039;t say. The odd misspelling wouldn&#039;t worry me hugely though. For a commercial site I consider it a huge red flag if I can&#039;t find address and telephone information readily but for a personal site this is normal.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If I didn&#039;t trust every site that had a misspelling on it, I would have to stop using the internet... after all it is people that build and maintain websites.

As to whether you can trust the site, look for a physical address, phone number, and privacy policy.
If still in doubt, go somewhere else...</Content>
