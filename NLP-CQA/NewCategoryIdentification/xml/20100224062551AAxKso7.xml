            <Content>It is not who falls in the first slot that matters really, it is who gives the most helpful answer.  Don&#039;t worry about being the first answer, worry more about giving a good, well informed, helpful answer.</Content>

            <Content>I have the same problem because my answers are usually more well thought out and I take the time to give detailed information, spell check my answers, site sources, etc. I think that providing a high quality answer is more important than being the first to post an answer that doesn&#039;t offer as much.</Content>
