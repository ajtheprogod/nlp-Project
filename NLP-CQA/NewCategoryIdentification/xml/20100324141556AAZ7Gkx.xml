    <Subject>Download of movie stopped half way!?</Subject>
    <Content>I just downloaded a movie and halfway through the movie just stopped downloading like it was through. The movie doesn&#039;t play. Even though I have half of the download it&#039;s just useless. Is there any way I can continue the download where I left off.
