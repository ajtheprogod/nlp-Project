    <ChosenAnswer>There are compatibility filters you can use in IE8, that may help
I tend to switch all the new &#039;features&#039; off myself when installing it (for my daughter)

Try a different browser, it doesn&#039;t hurt to have several installed - just be careful of the new browser making itself the default when you first install it, there should be a ticked box you can untick.

Firefox, Opera and Chrome all have their good points. I prefer Firefox with adblockplus myself</ChosenAnswer>
