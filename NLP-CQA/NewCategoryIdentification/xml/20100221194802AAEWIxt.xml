  <Question id="20100221194802AAEWIxt" type="Answered">
    <Subject>My sister&#039;s computer is having a problem with Internet Explorer - it won&#039;t allow her on any websites...?</Subject>
    <Content>Everytime she tries to go on anything, this pops up: http://s703.photobucket.com/albums/ww31/Well_Hello_Beautiful/?action=view&amp;current=vista-1.jpg&amp;newest=1
And when the scan is done, up pops some virus thing it says we have to buy. What could be wrong with it, and how could we try to fix it? 
Thanks. :)
Thanks for all the good answers, everyone! It&#039;s all better now. :)

    <ChosenAnswer>Nick is correct. Do a system restore.
As an added precaution i would do a full virus scan after the restore is complete to catch the virus and remove it, lowering the chances of the exact same thing happening again.

I also recommend using the Mozilla Firefox browser instead of Internet Explorer. Its much better, faster, more customizable and has heaps better security.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>What LoverRBoy said is correct.  It&#039;s time to  do a System Restore - 

Start ------&gt;  All Programs------&gt; Accesories---------&gt; System Restore

Then just pick a day before this happened.  What is does is change key registry files back to the way they were on the day you choose.   Virus add instructions to registry files that you don&#039;t want in there, then your computer executes them</Content>
