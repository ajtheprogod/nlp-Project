    <Subject>Maybe this shouldnt go here, but : Question about internet speed?</Subject>
    <Content>Question about internet speed?
i just got my own apartment, and i dont need much. However the only thing i need internet for is skyping or windows live video call to my girlfriend. We are very long distance. So, sudden link is the only provider in my area, and 1 mbps is 33 bucks , but the next one up is like 50! so i was wondering, is the 1 mbps internet speed fast enough for video calling. I hope so, I &#039;m just a poor college student! lol thanks
