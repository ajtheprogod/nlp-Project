    <ChosenAnswer>OK you have found an item you want, you place your maximum bid (the most you are prepared to pay) For example start price on the item is $10.00 you are prepared to pay $20.00, so you enter $20. If you are the first bidder, the price will still be $10 &amp; you will be the current highest bidder. If no one else bids, the item will be yours for $10 + whatever the postage costs are.

Using the same example if someone else bids &amp; they were to place a bid of say $15.00, they will be immediately outbid as ebay is bidding on your behalf (automatic or proxy bidding) Then the price will then be $15.50 ( 50 cents is the increment at this stage) If they bid again at $20.00 the same as you, you will still be the highest bidder as the earlier placed bid takes priority.(its a bit of a give away on your max bid when this happens as there wont be an increment )  Now this other bidder really wants the item as well, so they place another bid of $25.00. You will no longer be the highest bidder &amp; provided no one else bids, they will win the bid for $20.50.  

BTW No one else knows your max bid just you.

The increment that I mentioned before ranges on the current price of the auction. It increases when the bidding goes over certain $ values. I think if bidding goes over $25 the increment is $1, then over $100 it increases again. 

Thats it in a nutshell! of course there are many variables.Read ebays buying help for further info.

My advice (which you are free to disregard, this is just what I do if I really have to have something)
I will place my maximum bid in the last seconds of the auction, I will do this either manually (if I am home at the time or set it up with a auction sniping service  I use gixen.com.) 
The reason I snipe, I dont want to get into a bidding war &amp; have previously paid way more then what I wanted just to win! (I dont know if its my competitive nature or Im just stupid lol) 
I also add a couple of cents to my max bid as most buyers tend to bid in whole dollars instead of $20.00 make it $20.01. Cant tell how many times I have won the bid by 1 cent.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You simply register to the website, login and put the maximum amount you would like to pay for the item, then click bid now. You&#039;ll need a PayPal account or be able to use a credit/debit card to make the payment. Most sellers require payment the same day or not long after.

You don&#039;t pay until you become the winning bidder. It&#039;s very similar to a normal auction apart from it&#039;s on a website. As soon as the bidding ends, you would make the payment.</Content>
