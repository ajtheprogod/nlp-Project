  <Question id="20100304160106AA5pnGw" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is EU Ticket Shop legit? Has anyone had any experience with them?</Subject>
    <Content>Last night I ordered tickets for Eminem at T in the Park from this website: http://euticketshop.com/ They were Â£85 each which I didn&#039;t mind paying but now I&#039;m starting to worry, since the official T in the Park website has a warning saying be careful not to buy fake tickets; we recommend ticketmaster.com.

The most worrying thing to me is that the EU ticket shop people say they won&#039;t send me the tickets until a week before the concert, which is in July. This seems suspicious to me and I&#039;m going to be nervous waiting to see whether they arrive or not. Can anyone tell me if their website is a scam?
