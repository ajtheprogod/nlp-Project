  <Question id="20100308053440AAaMvcv" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there anyway I could load faster the page I vist so many times, in Firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>I mean some offline storage system only for one site. Not for all other. For instance; Social city on Face-book.

Please be descriptive.
Ppl please don&#039;t do that. Y! Ans is a good place for us to share our knowledge, a good place where ppl help and be helped.

So please before answering read it carefully what the asker is demanding.

I asked how I could LOAD the page FASTER. And I said some kind of OFFLINE STORAGE system. The example I&#039;ve given was Social City of Face Book. It takes time every time it LOAD, so how could I save their files on my system which are repeatedly loading every time I load the page, and instead of loading the files from there server the web page loads the files from my computer.
