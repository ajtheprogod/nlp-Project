  <Question id="20100317112513AAwlS7T" type="Answered">
    <Subject>what ever happened to AOL?</Subject>
    <Content>I remember when AOL was HUGE, everyone I knew had it and would talk about all the time (&quot;what version do you have? we just upgraded to 3.0&quot; etc) I remember the commercials were all over t.v. and having anything else was &quot;lame&quot; (I was in high school). Last I heard they merged with Time Warner Cable... and poof.... I don&#039;t even know if they exist anymore. How can in internet provider go from being #1 to nonexistent in only a few years? 2004 was the last time I heard anything about them?

    <ChosenAnswer>AOL has since been spun off from Time Warner effective a few months ago and is run imdependently. Over the years it has gradually lost a lot of its client base and its decision to discontinue support of the Netscape web browser a few years ago hasn&#039;t helped matters.

They also split its internet access and advertising business in 2008 and it was suggested at that time that they may selloff the internet access divison at a later time.

Although it is still around along with its products such as AOL Mail, AIM messenger, etc,  competition is fierce and AOL are clearly losing the ISP war.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>AOL is fine and well. I use it all time. I have had AOL for 14 years. I started with 1.5 now I have 9.5
I have all 7 screen names, and use them every day. AOL is a lot better than some of the other complicated crap. I can go on all 7 of my screen names a the same time on 7 different computers.
I think it is well worth the cost. I also have 3 yahoo e-mail accounts, 1 gmail, 1 ATT.net, 3 facebook accounts, and one my space account.</Content>

            <Content>AOL is alive and well! They split with Time Warner about a month or so ago. I&#039;ve had AOL for about 4 years now. I have the 9.0 VR and it is very good. AOL is a very good internet provider and has many good features. Good security features, spam filter and browsing.</Content>
