  <Question id="20100325132258AAt9UuT" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I destroy my old website?</Subject>
    <Content>I made a website years ago that I eventually gave up on because the host was difficult to work with. I have not made a payment for this site or conducted any maintenance in like four years, but the website remains in existence. Why is the host continuing to serve a website that I&#039;m not paying for, and how do I get rid of the site?

    <ChosenAnswer>You can do this a couple of different ways. First though, you should find out why the old host hasn&#039;t deleted the content if your account is closed. You should also check on WHOISIT.COM to make sure your web site domain name hasn&#039;t been bought by someone else.

Primarily, if the story doesn&#039;t change much from what I&#039;ve already said... 

Re-register your domain name and transfer it to your new host.

Put up a simple page that redirects your old site to your new site. You should do this with a page so that your visitors understand that the old site is no longer active. You&#039;ll eventually be able to drop the old name after enough of your clientèle learns the new address.</ChosenAnswer>
