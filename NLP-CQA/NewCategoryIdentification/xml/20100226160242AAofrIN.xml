    <Subject>What do you wish you could do on the Internet?</Subject>
    <Content>The Internet has come pretty far in the past decade, but undoubtedly we will see even more new things over the next ten years. My question to you is: what would you like to be able to do on the Internet or on your computer, cellphone, or other mobile device that you can&#039;t currently do?

Think about it for a little bit before you answer.

Okay, let&#039;s hear your thoughts.......

    <ChosenAnswer>I would like to be able to call certain people all over the world that I&#039;ve connected with on YA.  There are some I feel I know well, and others I am just getting to know.  One or two I worry about.  It&#039;s too expensive and scary for some people.  I like being able to hear a voice.</ChosenAnswer>
