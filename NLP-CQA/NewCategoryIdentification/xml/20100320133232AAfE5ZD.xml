            <Content>Q1. Will I be charged by twitter on my phone from them sending me updates?

A1: Depends, do you have unlimited text messaging with your cell provider, or do you pay for text messages? Twitter won&#039;t charge you, but a text message is a text message no matter who sends it, and your cell provider might/will/could..

Q2. My number will not get out on the site will it?

A2: NOTHING you give any site is 100% safe. Hackers hack for a reason. If they hack twitter, then yeah - it could happen.

Q3. Will I be able to cancel the mobile updates when I want?

A3: Yes.

Here&#039;s an interesting site you might want to review before you start telling all your followers where you are, and what you&#039;re doing. It&#039;s not Twitter-based, but the idea can very easily be extended (and who knows - someone may already be doing it privately):

Interesting how people who would scold a child for talking to strangers are so willing to tell strangers on the Internet where they are and what they&#039;re doing themselves, don&#039;t you think?</Content>
