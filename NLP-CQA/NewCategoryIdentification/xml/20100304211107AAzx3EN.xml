    <Subject>A person commented on a post on my Tumblr. How do I reply?</Subject>
    <Content>I wrote something and one of my followers commented on it. I would like to reply to her comment but don&#039;t see where I can do so! If she can comment on my Tumblr posts, there MUST be a way that I can too, right?

    <ChosenAnswer>Well.... you could actually do a text post and go @inserttheirusernamehere in the title and then write a reply to them. But if you&#039;re talking about them reblogging and then answering you.... then just reblog the thing they said and then answer from there.</ChosenAnswer>
