    <Subject>On the game Maple Story, why does my characters keep getting deleted?</Subject>
    <Content>Sometimes I don&#039;t have time to play and when I log back on, all my characters are gone. Its really frustrating and it makes me not want to play it anymore because if I put work into it, they&#039;ll just be deleted the next time I get on. Why is that?

            <Content>Sounds like your account got hacked.  You should change your password and see if it still happens, and if it does, then it&#039;s just the game&#039;s way of punishing you for not playing in such a long time.  I don&#039;t really play the game, but that&#039;s usually what happens when someone else hacks an account.  Just be glad you can still log on, and once you do, change  your password ASAP!</Content>
