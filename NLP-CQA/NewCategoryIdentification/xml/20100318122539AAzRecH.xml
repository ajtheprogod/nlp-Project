    <ChosenAnswer>Are you using Internet Explorer 8?

Try enabling compatibility mode. It is the broken page icon next to the refresh button on the toolbar. Here’s a good resource from the IEBlog that talks about compatibility mode in detail if you’d like to learn more: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/02/16/just-the-facts-recap-of-compatibility-view.aspx 

If that doesn’t work, run IE in No Add-ons Mode.  Go to Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) - If this fixes the issue, then go to Tools -&gt; Manage Add-ons and enable the add-ons one by one to find which one was causing the problem. 

You can also try resetting Internet Explorer&#039;s settings by going to Tools &gt; Internet Options and then the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, and click &quot;Reset...&quot; 

If you’re still not having any luck, I recommend you reinstall IE8 on your system.

I hope this helps!
