    <ChosenAnswer>I used to use Lockerz but I was never able to redeem my points for anything... they never stock up! So I tried out Points2Shop, and they have a bunch of different ways to earn points (you can click on a website and earn points!)

When you get enough points you can get ANYTHING from Amazon. Or you can just have money sent to your PayPal. You can play racing games, shooting games, fill out surveys and quizzes, gamble and play the weekly lottery and earn points while doing it.

Please copy/paste this and sign up!: google points2shop and please put your referrer as Tyman3, it helps me and gives you 250 points for free!</ChosenAnswer>
