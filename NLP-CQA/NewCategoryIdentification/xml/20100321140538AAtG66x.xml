    <Subject>Is ebay Safe to buy from?</Subject>
    <Content>I have seen somethings on ebay which i have not found anywhere else. I want to buy this mans hairband like the ones you see Fernando Torres wear etc but cant seem to find them them anywhere and indian necklace with an om sign. If you know another website please paste otherwise is ebay safe for me to buy items such as these, its just that i have only started buying off the internet because i know some people who have bad experiences with internet buying.
thanks

    <ChosenAnswer>Ebay is very safe, a bit too safe !! but always check the sellers feedback scores and comments other buyers have left, and always use paypal as this is the fastest and safest way to pay, in case you don&#039;t receive your item, eBay and paypal would do their best to get your refund!! But its quite expensive to sell things, and i would recommend gumtree !! gud luk !!</ChosenAnswer>
