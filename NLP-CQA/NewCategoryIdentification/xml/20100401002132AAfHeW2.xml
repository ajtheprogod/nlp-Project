    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;d say Chat Roulette.  I have some friends who&#039;ve had fairly long conversations with people from all over the world.  Supposedly, there&#039;s some perverts on this site - you can skip them til you find someone you wanna talk to- but the majority of its users are just wanting to talk to somebody.</ChosenAnswer>
