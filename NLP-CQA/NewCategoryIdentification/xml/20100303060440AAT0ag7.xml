    <ChosenAnswer>It has it&#039;s origins in season 2 episode 17 of South Park, &#039;Underpants Gnomes&#039;

In it, the character Tweek has his underpants stolen by gnomes, and when investigating why, they explain their process of getting profit from his underpants, which was:

Phase 1: Collect Underpants
Phase 2: ?
Phase 3: Profit

the humour being derived from nobody knowing the step between collecting the underpants and profit.

It was brought up as an internet meme probably by 4chan or 7chan</ChosenAnswer>
