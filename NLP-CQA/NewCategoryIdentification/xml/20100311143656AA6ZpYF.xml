    <Subject>How much does internet &quot;cost&quot;?</Subject>
    <Content>I don&#039;t mean how much do ISPs (internet service providers) charge us, but rather what is the cost for them to provide internet?

I figure since most North American ones tend to be routed in phone companies, they already have plenty of servers, and running them can&#039;t trully cost anything near what people pay per month, so what&#039;s the markup?

            <Content>I have AT&amp;T extreme 6.0 their fastest speed. It runs 42 bucks per/month.  they have three or four different plans, their cheapest is 19.95, which is just a notch above dialup. I might also add that my extreme 6.0 is regular 47 bucks, by doing a bundle package I save 5 bucks.</Content>
