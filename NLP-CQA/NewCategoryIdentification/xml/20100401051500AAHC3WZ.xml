    <Subject>are there any effective ad blockers for internet explorer 8?</Subject>
    <Content>ive found good adblockers for firefox and chrome.   but i also use internet explorer 8 from time to time .   

im not a fan of ads showing on websites  , dont ask me why, im just not .

the host file that i installed for internet explorer  doesn&#039;t  block ads to well, especially on yahoo answers ,  which i find the most annoying.


any good ad blockers that work for internet  explorer 8 ?

            <Content>Personally i dont know why anyone would use Internet Explorer. Its is made by Microsoft (so its shit), and its really slow.

You should download Google Chrome
Its is waaaaay faster, looks better etc.

In Google Chrome if you click the picture of a Spanner in the top right and lcik Extensions, then Get Extensions there are loads of things you can install.
Including loads of AdBlockers.
