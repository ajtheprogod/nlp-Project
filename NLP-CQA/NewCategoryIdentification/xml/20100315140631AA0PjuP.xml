  <Question id="20100315140631AA0PjuP" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I need help with Flowplayer?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a php website I designed using dreamweaver (yay just another program to make coding obsolete so I know nothing about it). I entered this DIRECTLY under the &lt;head&gt; tag in my site code:

&lt;script src=http://www.MYWEBSITE.com/flowplayer/extras/flowPlayer.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Than I added this directed above my &lt;/body&gt; tag in mt script at the end of the page:


href=http://www.MYWEBSITE.com/Videos/LastChance/Episode1.flv&quot;
style=&quot;display:block;width:425px;height:300px;&quot;
id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;

&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
flowplayer(&quot;player&quot;, http://www.MYWEBSITE.com/flowplayer/extras/flowPlayer.js&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;

And when I go to the site it shows nothing there at all, but if I cursor over to where the video SHOULD be my cursor turns into the clickable hand icon and when I click a dialog box appears asking if I want to open or save the video (as if I were downloading it) Please help me out! I just want a general idea of getting this to work.

NOTE: I do have my entire flowplayer folder hosted on my server and the URL&#039;s in the script are accurate.
