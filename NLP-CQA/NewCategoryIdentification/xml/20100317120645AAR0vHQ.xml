  <Question id="20100317120645AAR0vHQ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Internet history in firefox..?</Subject>
    <Content>People keep mentioning that you should be able to give a time-span for which items you want deleted when deleting history - i cannot see this option anywhere?

for example, if you select the option to have firefox delete all history every time firefox is closed, does that delete your ENTIRE history, or just the most recent?

thanks
Jamie - i don&#039;t seem to have an option for clearing recent history under the privacy tab?
:/

            <Content>it deletes ALL of it, if you would like to delete it with in a certain amount of time you have to goto tools &gt; options &gt; privacy &gt; then click on where it says &quot;clear your recent history&quot; then at the top there is a drop down list of the time limits, like last two hours , last hour , everything etc....
Hope i helped
