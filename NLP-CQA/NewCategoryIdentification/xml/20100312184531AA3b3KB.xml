    <ChosenAnswer>It sounds like you&#039;ve become victim to a browser Hi-jack. Also for future
record don&#039;t click on &#039;run&#039; when something like this happens. Basically
when the browser opened the Hi-jack tried to download/save a file. When
you click &#039;run&#039; it automatically runs w/e the Hi-jacker wanted you to
download. If it was a virus then you&#039;re now even more heavily infected
then you were before.

If you&#039;re able to transfer any files onto the computer then you will need
to download and transfer the following files onto the machine. The links
are labeled with short details about each. They&#039;re all trusted and none
will harm your computer.

FireFox - A powerful web browser built on security and reliability in mind.
It&#039;s been nominated the best and most secure web browser for more than
4 years running. There&#039;s a lot of competition out there but FireFox still
stands as my personal favorite:

To download FireFox click the link below. You should be prompted to
download after the page loads.
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.6&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US


A-Squared. A very powerful anti-virus and anti-malware application that&#039;s
shown amazing results on even the most infected machines. It&#039;s easy
to install and very easy to use. Run a full system scan and wait for it
to complete. Click on the &quot;Download Now&quot; button and save it to your
hard drive like the link before.
http://download.cnet.com/A-squared-Free/3000-8022_4-10262215.html?part=dl-6251182&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button



ZoneAlarm Free and Basic firewall. Although it&#039;s free that doesn&#039;t mean
it&#039;s going to crap out on you. With sleek looking alerts and plenty of
advisory tips you&#039;re going to love this firewall. If you get an alert and you
don&#039;t know what it is? Or if you&#039;re sure it&#039;s a threat. Then simply click
decline.It takes a little getting used to but you can count on ZoneAlarm
to always be up to date.

Download ZoneAlarm
http://download.cnet.com/ZoneAlarm/3000-10435_4-10039884.html?part=dl-69168&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button


For added security you can also get the ZoneAlarm SpyBlocker which
is from the same creator of ZoneAlarm, Check Point. This way you
can block threats and help navigate from websites before any damage
can be done.

Download Spy Blocker:
http://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/spyblocker-download.htm




Keep in mind that with all of this security you will notice a small
to medium decrease in performance. If you feel your computer
is running too slow then feel free to disable the firewall by right
clicking on the &#039;Z&#039; icon ( also looks like red/green bars ) on the
bottom right of your screen and click on &#039;Disable ZoneAlarm&#039;.

All of the software is free and has proven to be the most effective
in the working environment. If you have any questions feel free
to ask.
