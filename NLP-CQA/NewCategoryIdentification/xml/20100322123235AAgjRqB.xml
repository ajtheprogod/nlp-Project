    <Subject>What are some interesting email newsletters I should subscribe to?</Subject>
    <Content>I am subscribed to the Freshome.com newsletter, and I find it interesting. I think email newsletters are easier than remembering to go to the website every other day. Do you have any good newsletters that are interesting and worthwhile? (FYI: I don&#039;t find Holiday&#039;s Inn newsletter interesting)
