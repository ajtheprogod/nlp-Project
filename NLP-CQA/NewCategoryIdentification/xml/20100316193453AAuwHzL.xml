    <ChosenAnswer>Thanks for answering my question btw! I will just try &amp; if a restaurant turns me away for my little guy then o well I guess lol
I sell on ebay and I got frustriated when I would take the time to leave nice feedback for my buyers and they wouldnt do the same for me!
So, I decided, like a lot of other sellers, to not leave feedback until the buyer leaves it. I like this practice and it gets a lot of buyers who would usually not bother to leave feedback actually take the time to leave me some! haha :)
It is also good in a way, because that way, when the buyer leaves you feedback, you know that the item has arrived and they are happy with it. You can tell a lot about a buyer if something is wrong with their item/order and they act like a monster in dealing with it. In those cases, because we aren&#039;t allowed to leave negative feedback anymore, I just don&#039;t leave any.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Not angry maybe a bit disappointed that the buyer/seller couldnt be bothered to extend me the same courtesy especially when I have left them a glowing comment but at the end of the day, I dont care its not as if I can eat or spend it :)</Content>
