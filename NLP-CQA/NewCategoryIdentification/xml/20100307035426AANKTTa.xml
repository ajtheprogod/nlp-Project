  <Question id="20100307035426AANKTTa" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Internet explorer is always running?</Subject>
    <Content>I was recently trying to install adobe fireworks and it said that i needed to close internet explorer to continue. I was confused because internet explorer was already closed. So i went into task manager and tried to force close internet explorer, it closed then instantly opened again, i have run spybot and AVG and neither pick up any viruses...

If anyone else has experienced similar things and knows how to fix it please tell me, i really need these programs!

P.S when i open task manager there are two internet explorers one running at 56,000 and the other at 6,000... neither will close.. thankyou to anyone who can help!
By task manager i mean processes tab, have tried restarting... also closing programs that may be accessing internet explorer... eg windows live messenger... Thanks anyway.

    <ChosenAnswer>Don&#039;t know why it would reopen after closing it in task manager... could be there&#039;s another program trying to access the internet using IE.

Have you tried closing it in the Processes tab rather than Applications?  I think it&#039;s called ieexplore.exe.

There is a good program that gives you a much more detailed view of the processes running, you could see if any other program is running that doesn&#039;t need to be and closing that to see if it helps.

If that still doesn&#039;t work try restarting your computer, that often fixes weird stuff like this for me :)</ChosenAnswer>
