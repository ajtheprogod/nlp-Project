    <ChosenAnswer>If you are on a wifi with your laptop and it&#039;s not secured by WPA or better WPA2 (encrypted) then anyone can get on your wifi &amp; see exactly what&#039;s going on. If it&#039;s secured, then no, nobody can see what you see

            <Content>It is possible for someone to hack into your computer and see what you are running yes.  However, this is unlikely especially if you have proper Firewall/AV and even then it&#039;s unlikely they&#039;ll be able to see exactly what you are viewing.  If the other person you&#039;re worried about doesn&#039;t have computer skills then no don&#039;t worry about it.</Content>

            <Content>Not remotely, aka it&#039;s difficult. Someone would have to hack into your computer or otherwise plant a trojan in your system, but if your computer is clean of viruses no one can know what your doing.</Content>
