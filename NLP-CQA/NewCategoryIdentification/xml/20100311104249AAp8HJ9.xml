    <ChosenAnswer>According to eBay policy you are obligated to sell the item to the winner of the auction regardless of the price (that&#039;s the main point for an auction isn&#039;t it?). 

However, you can obviously cancel the transaction and not sell the item to the highest bidder. The bad side to this is you might have a negative feedback (which is very likely). 

If the price is too low for you and you don&#039;t really care much about your reputation on eBay then you might want to go ahead with the second option.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yes-  if you&#039;re worried about it, you are supposed to set a Reserve Price, but that deters bidders.</Content>

            <Content>Yes, when you put the item on ebay, you are agreeing to a binding contract. If you were worried about the sale price, you should have set a reserve price, which would mean you wouldn&#039;t have to sell unless they matched the price you wanted. 

Contact the bidder and tell them your problem, chances are they will understand.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>Yes. I guess you could cancel the item but you would get bad feedback. If you want a certain amount for it start the bid at that price, buy it now or set a reserve price.</Content>
