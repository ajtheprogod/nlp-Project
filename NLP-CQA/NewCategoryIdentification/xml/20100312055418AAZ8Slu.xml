Yes, technically the US should be &quot;.US&quot; and canada should be &quot;.CA&quot;  . ..  and yes, &quot;.COM&quot; can be used anywhere in the world. . . . but typically, Canada uses the same as us. Where, other countries use their own &quot;assigned&quot; domain extension.</Content>

            <Content>Hi,

It generally describes the entity owning the domain name as a commercial organization. Along with the second-level domain name (for example: &quot;yahoo&quot; in yahoo.com), the top-level domain name is required in Web and e-mail addresses. 

In Canada it&#039;s .ca</Content>
