  <Question id="20100324153258AANG5sW" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Website that forces you to keep typing?</Subject>
    <Content>I found this website awhile ago -- you have to keep typing, because the second you stop typing it starts to delete some of your work. I forget what it is called and I cannot find it on google, but its purpose is to help you finish an essay, overcome writer&#039;s block, etc.

Thank you!!
