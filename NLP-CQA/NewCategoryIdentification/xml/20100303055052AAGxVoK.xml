  <Question id="20100303055052AAGxVoK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why would someone need a download manager such as DownThemAll or FlashGot as a Firefox add on?</Subject>
    <Content>Why would someone need to download a ton of information from a webpage?  What are they doing with it?  Same with FlashGot... why would someone need to download all the links and video ect from a particular webpage?  It sounds really neat, but I can&#039;t imagine what I would need to do that for?  Please explain what I might use that for... :)

    <ChosenAnswer>Oh for example: You are part of a group which posts event pictures on their site and for some reason you want to download them to view them offline. FlashGot is way faster than [r-click -&gt; save picture] repeat. Same applies with any other kind of files - maybe you are into modding games and want to download a load of texture files.

Simple answer: It saves time.</ChosenAnswer>
