    <Subject>Should fanmakes of movies on  fanfiction.net be banned from  the site?</Subject>
    <Content>While looking on fanfiction.net I saw several stories  that are being written by a member called &quot;JusSonic&quot; who parodies movies with cartoon characters, I personally think that these so-called fanmake stories I have seen should be deleted and fanfiction.net create a rule from these kinds of stories from appearing on their sites. Does anyone agree or disagree with me on if fanfiction.net should ban fanmake stories of movies from their site?
These fanmakes include dialouge from the ACTUAL movies

    <ChosenAnswer>If they&#039;re merely parodies and no copyright content is used, perhaps the site regards this as acceptable content.  Americans seem obsessed with parodies</ChosenAnswer>
