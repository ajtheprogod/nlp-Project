    <ChosenAnswer>Websites you&#039;ve visited are usually stored in History, unless you&#039;re paranoid and delete it every time you log off.

Otherwise, IE8 doesn&#039;t keep track of downloads like Firefox and some other browsers do. You might as well just ask where to find what you downloaded before.</ChosenAnswer>
