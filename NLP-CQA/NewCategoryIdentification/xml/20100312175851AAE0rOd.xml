            <Content>If you go to the FAQ section of  the Secret.com website it says the following...

Is it true that Secret Platinum has been replaced with Secret Flawless™?

Yes, it&#039;s true. As of May of 2008, Secret Platinum is no longer available. Instead, you will find Secret Flawless™ on store shelves. So, if you&#039;re a devoted Platinum user, have no fear. The Flawless™ line has something perfect for you, including Flawless Renewal™. With movement-activated odor protection, the more you move, the more it works.
See all Flawless Invisible Solids, Clear Gels and Conditioning Solids.

Hope this helps</Content>
