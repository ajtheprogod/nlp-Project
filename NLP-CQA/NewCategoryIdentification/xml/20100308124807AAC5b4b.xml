    <Content>Hello! I have a very serious problem. A friend of mine, has used my computer to get in various sites. But I try to delete the history, and I just f***ing can&#039;t! I tried deleting it manually, but the tools--&gt; internet options, by spybot search and destroy, and even by CCleaner! and the stupid history is just there, like nothing happened! It&#039;s not all history, but when I type in the address bar a specific word, it shows me the site he has been. i tried clicking on the x, and still it doesn&#039;t get deleted! Please please please help! I want to delete this ASAP!

I am pretty sure you understanded what sites I am talking about, that I can&#039;t get rid off!... And it is really a privacy thing! So one last time: HELP!!! Please I am horrified that anyone might find out! I just can&#039;t get rid of it! :-(

    <ChosenAnswer>depending on what version you have tools to internet options should work. you might have your privacy setting real high and it wont allow you to delete it. 

one thing you can do is go into my computer right click on the c: drive. click on properties. then go to disk clean up. make sure everything is checked and do that. that should work</ChosenAnswer>
