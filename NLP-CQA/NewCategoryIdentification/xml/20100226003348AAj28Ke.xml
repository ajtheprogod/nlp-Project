            <Content>There is no way...of course not all parents have their kids best interests at heart but 99.999999999% of us do.  If your folks don&#039;t want you to have something, there is probably a good reason for it. If you are having trouble talking to your parents, ask another adult you trust about this purchase you want to make and see what he/she thinks.  I&#039;ll bet it&#039;s a bad idea.  PS, if you are only 12, you are too young to be on Yahoo answers.</Content>
