    <ChosenAnswer>When completing offers, make sure your zip code, phone number, and address are fake but match your location. Other than that, you can use fake info. Good luck! It&#039;s possible to earn 50+ points a month once you get up to speed.

[EDIT]: I forgot to mention - use the same fake information every time, but create a new (not temporary) email every few offers. Probably the reason for the down-vote lol.</ChosenAnswer>
