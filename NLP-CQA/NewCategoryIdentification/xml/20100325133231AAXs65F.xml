    <ChosenAnswer>mine just started doing that, it is a serious pain in the...  earlier I had some rodent eating my cables outside.  You must get them to look into it, it will not get better, and you are paying for that.  what I did was tell them they would pay me back for all of the cable I paid since I first stopped getting good service, and told them about it!  they got out there real quick, I got a refund but not the whole thing.  I am on the third time around.  but at least they know I am serious, and that it really is not me being a pain (I did not drop my soda on the router or something).</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It could be your modem, it could also be that you are out of their range for high speed internet, they neglect to tell you that until you start having problems.</Content>
