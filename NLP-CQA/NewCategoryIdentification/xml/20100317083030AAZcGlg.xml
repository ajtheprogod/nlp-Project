    <ChosenAnswer>Well music.yahoo.com has music videos that are not blocked by the school server, but if you want to get on movie and tv sites your best bet is to use a proxy. A proxy is a site that you can type an address into and it will allow you to visit the site. Type in proxy in the address bar and see what ones come up try using each one until it will let you get on the site you want.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I would guess that they have them all blocked. You&#039;re supposed to be doing other things besides watching videos at school.</Content>
