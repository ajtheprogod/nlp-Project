    <Content>I am interested in hooking up a computer in another room (so that I can have internet access in 2 different rooms).....do I need to contact the phone company and pay additional charges or is there a way I can have it in both rooms without getting another box? I have no clue....any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>you don&#039;t need to call the phone company.
simply buy a router and run new lines from the router to both computers.
if you can&#039;t run new lines, then buy a wireless router. a wireless router such as : http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-WRT54GL-Wireless-G-Broadband-Compatible/dp/B000BTL0OA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1269451901&amp;sr=8-1
will allow you to connect your one computer with a ethernet cord as you do now, and your other computer wirelessly. if you second computer doesn&#039;t have a built in wireless reciever then you would also need: http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-Cisco-WMP54G-Wireless-G-Adapter/dp/B000085BD8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1269452003&amp;sr=8-2
