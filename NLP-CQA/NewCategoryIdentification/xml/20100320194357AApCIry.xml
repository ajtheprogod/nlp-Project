    <Subject>Is a camera required for Chatroulette?</Subject>
    <Content>I was using chatroulette a lot about a week ago, and then I stopped because I started getting all sorts of disgusting partners so I just quit.. but when I tried to go back on it today, there was no choice of checking whether or not to send my video.  There&#039;s still a box to check for audio, but there used to be one for video too!

Has this happened to anyone else? I don&#039;t usually send video when I use chatroulette just to be safe, so if I am required to send video I think I&#039;ll have to stop using it. :/

Thanks!
