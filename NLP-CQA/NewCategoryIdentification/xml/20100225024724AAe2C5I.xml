    <ChosenAnswer>You can create a new account, configure your email software for that account, then remove the old one from your account options.

You may be better off not deleting the old one (not sure how to!), as inevitably there&#039;s always a site somewhere that you signed up to using that address, and will need to change it before you get rid of it.</ChosenAnswer>
