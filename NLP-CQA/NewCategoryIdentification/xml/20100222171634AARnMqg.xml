    <ChosenAnswer>I assume for the following that it&#039;s the same as my FIOS if not the following may not apply:

He should have a User id he got from them that starts with &quot;VZ&quot; and them some more text and words.  Then go to Verizon.com and you should see a &quot;My Verizon Sign In&quot; box.  Type in the user name that starts with VZ along with the password they gave you.  Next click on the &quot;My Account&quot; tab.  And select &quot;Add Sub Account/Email&quot;.  Follow the steps it&#039;ll tell you and there you go.</ChosenAnswer>
