    <Subject>What are some good virtual world sites?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve been looking for ages and I can&#039;t find any good virtual world sites! I&#039;m looking for some that are for kids around 14 (like Runescape or ourWorld). Thanks :-)
Oh, and preferably no downloading and for free.

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi there, have you heard of The Travels of Wiglington and Wenks Virtual World?

I had tried it and I think it is great!

It&#039;s a new virtual world for kids and tweens (some even said teens!). It already received tens of thousands of signups from over 140 countries.

You can travel around the world, adopt all kinds of cool pets, build houses and islands, wear clothings from different countries, play tons of games and more. Best of all, it&#039;s free to play and you don&#039;t need to download anything to install.

Here&#039;s a short description of it.

&quot;The Travels of Wiglington and Wenks promises an experience in which players would be able to travel to factual and mysterious places around the world, travel through time and space, meet famous people from the past, play dozens of enriching and fun games, make new friends and party with them, buy exotic islands, build culture-inspired houses, wear clothes from different countries, explore secret locations, solve mysteries and puzzles and become a legendary traveler!&quot;
