    <ChosenAnswer>Hello, 
First you will have to register a domain name. Just google domain name registration and you&#039;ll get plenty of results. Or, if you wish, you could &#039;register&#039; for subdomain through your webhost. This is free but the downside is it is not considered search engine friendly. So supposing the name of you web host is abxy.com, your domain name would be www.yourdomain.abxy.com

Next, you&#039;ll need a host to host your website. You can either get a free webhost and you can pay. Free ones are fine but take note they are notorious for going belly up all of a sudden.

One you have selected your web host, you can easily make a website using the website builders of web hosts. The website builders will have templates for you to choose from, which you can edit if you know HTML. Use the drag and drop feature to add text, pictures etc to your website. Once you&#039;re done creating the website, just click publish and you&#039;re done.

Alternatively, use a website development software such as Dreamweaver to create your website. The advantage here is that you decide exactly how you want the website to look. The upload all these files to your webhost&#039;s server, and that&#039;s it.

Good luck.</ChosenAnswer>
