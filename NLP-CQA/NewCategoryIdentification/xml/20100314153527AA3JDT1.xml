    <ChosenAnswer>I say do it.  As long as you write article that people might find via a search engine and you are also active on other fashion and beauty blogs and sites, you have a better chance of people wanting to check out your blog.  There are millions of blogs (~113 billion)  so don&#039;t expect thousands of hit right away.  Like everything else, you have to start somewhere.</ChosenAnswer>
