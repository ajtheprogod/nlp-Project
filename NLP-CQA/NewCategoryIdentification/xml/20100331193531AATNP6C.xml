    <Subject>How do I make a Livejournal Layout?</Subject>
    <Content>Where can I find a website that will help me create a Livejournal layout, or maybe a place where some can make it for me? I&#039;ve tried googling it, but the tutorials I&#039;ve looked at are confusing and I wasn&#039;t able to do anything with them orz
I want a Simple/Clean layout. I&#039;d also like to stick with S2!

    <ChosenAnswer>1.Login to your account and go to &quot;Journal Display.&quot; This page can be reached by going to &quot;Customize&quot; under &quot;Your Settings.&quot;


2.Set your Journal to &quot;S1 System Style.&quot; This is found on the first page of the &quot;Journal Settings&quot; page at the bottom of the text box. This allows you to change the HTML of your journal.



3.Click on the &quot;Custom Options&quot; tab. This will take you to the area for the HTML code for your journal. The HTML Code is in the &quot;Overrides&quot; box.


4.Carefully read through the HTML Code. Most of the Code is self explanatory. Text-family deals with the text style you want to use. Background-color or background-image deals with how the background behind the text is going to look.


5.Take the picture that you want to use for the Journal. With a website like Photobucket, create your own http:// link to the picture. Don&#039;t link to pictures on other people&#039;s web pages.


6.Create a theme around the picture that you&#039;ve chosen. The comment links on each Journal entry can be changed to fit this theme. For example if your using the picture of a star you can make the background color around the picture black, use a star color for the text, like white or gold, and have your &quot;Friends Comment Link&quot; say &quot;Catch a Shooting Star&quot; and the Link to comments be &quot;# Star Caught.&quot;


7.Change your Journal HTML bit by bit. Change something and then view your Journal to see how that change affected the Journal and the theme.
