    <Subject>Why has the RSS feed on my WordPress blog disappeared and how can I get it back?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve got a Wordpress blog being hosted by Godaddy and I was just trying to set up an RSS feed for it but when I clicked on the &quot;Subscribe&quot; link to see if it worked, I got the message &quot;This feed no longer exists.&quot; Here&#039;s the URL:

http://www.survivalprep.net/feed/

I don&#039;t remember deleting any files in my FTP directory, but if I did is there a way to restore them? Or could the problem be somewhere else? Or is there something else that I should do?
Leenus, I just activated a different theme but I&#039;m still getting the message &quot;This feed no longer exists.&quot;

    <ChosenAnswer>Why should I stock up on stuff? Part 2: Buy it, then hide it!

Why should I stock up on stuff if people will just steal it anyway?

If these are some of the posts on your blog and you are not able to view your Rss feed on your website, then its a problem with the theme you have installed but not the Wordpress.

Try to download some random themes and check whether you can see the RSS button or not.</ChosenAnswer>
