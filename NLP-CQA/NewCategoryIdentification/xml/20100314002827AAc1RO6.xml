    <Subject>Help emails not working on outlook express?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi

I hope someone can help. I have two dedicated servers lets call them server 1 and server 2. On server 1 i have 11 email accounts set up and on server 2  11 emails accounts as well. I have them all set up in outlook express. It was all working fine and all the email accounts on server 2 are still working fine, they send and receive, but for some reason the email accounts from server 1 are not receiving now. I can send emails but when i press send/receive on outlook express it comes up with a red cross next to the email accounts and doesn&#039;t work then it comes up with the following error: The connection to the server has failed. Account: &#039;My email account&#039;, Server: &#039;my website address&#039;, Protocol: POP3, Port: 110, Secure(SSL): No, Socket Error: 10013, Error Number: 0x800CCC0E

Does anyone why it is that it will send but not receive and the others from the other server are working fine. What can i do to fix this? Help please!
