  <Question id="20100226212331AAHXsER" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does this website look legit to you?</Subject>
    <Content>I recently got a traffic ticket in Florida(Where I live) so I wanted to do a Driver&#039;s improvement course, to prevent the points from being taken away from my License and the insurance going up. However, I became a little skeptical, when during the sign up phase, the website wanted my Card&#039;s zip number, not CVN. Is there a reason for this?

This is the website, http://www.lowestpricetrafficschool.com/
The website does ask for the CVN as well and not just the card&#039;s zip, but just both.
