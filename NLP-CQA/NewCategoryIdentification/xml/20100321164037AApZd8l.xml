    <Subject>How do I convert my audacity podcast to an mp3 format?</Subject>

    <ChosenAnswer>At audacity.sourceforge.net/, on the &#039;Downloads&#039; page and in the left menu under &#039;Plug-ins and Libraries&#039; -- you find the &#039;Lame faq&#039; link, that (finally, WHEW) leads you to the &#039;Lame Download page&#039;.

Anyway, once you have that saved to your computer, run the program. You only need to do this once, so that Audacity &#039;knows&#039; where to find the Lame Encoder. 

When saving your entire compilation, be sure export the entire length as mp3-- in comparison to the export selection as mp3 option, in which you click on the exact selection you wish to export (making it a deeper gray color than the other imports). 

Also: When saving the song, and choosing folder options and such, be sure to choose the &#039;Mp3 File&#039; as the output.</ChosenAnswer>
