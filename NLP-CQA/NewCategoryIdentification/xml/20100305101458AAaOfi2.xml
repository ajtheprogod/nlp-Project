    <ChosenAnswer>Make sure that you are using Microsoft Windows, otherwise you need to use other methods

Make sure that Num Lock is on.

Hold down the left Alt key.

Type 3 on the numeric keypad. The 3 on the numeric row of keys will not work.

Release the left Alt key.

On a lap tap, you may have to press the Fn key to help turn Num Lock on and press the Fn key before pressing the key which will provide you with a numeric keypad 3. Check your lap top documentation for details on this. Some lap tops do it differently and a few cannot do it.

Make sure you do not have a utility running that might interfere with your normal keyboard functions.

Also try Alt 1, Alt 2, Alt 4 and so forth. Every value from Alt 1 to Alt 255 should give a different character, after which the sequence will repeat. The character corresponds to its position in your current 8-bit DOS character set. If you type a 0 in front of the number, you will instead get the character with that number in your current 8-bit Windows character set.</ChosenAnswer>
