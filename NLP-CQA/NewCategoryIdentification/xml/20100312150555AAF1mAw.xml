    <Subject>Things to do on the computer?</Subject>
    <Content>Me and my friend find out that we get REALLY bored on the computer, fast. I don&#039;t have a facebook or myspace, my parents won&#039;t let me, and it would help if you could send me links that DON&#039;T have viruses. Thanks, bunches!

    <ChosenAnswer>You can use SpywareNoMore. 
As we all know Computer hackers seeking financial gain rather than thrills or notoriety are increasingly flooding the Internet with malicious software code (spyware, adware, key loggers, trojans). They are infecting computers with highly sophisticated programs that record surfing habits, bank passwords and other key financial data and send them to crooks over the Internet. These programs can be hard to spot, disguised in downloads such as toolbars, search engines, browser accessories, screen savers and other seemingly helpful utilities.

SpyNoMore anti-spyware safeguards your identity and restores system performance through fast, smart and powerful spyware protection.
