    <Subject>Verizon High Speed Internet General Question.?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay, well I just paid for Verizon High Speed Internet (FIOS isn&#039;t available in the hicks). I got telephone line &quot;adapters&quot; in the mail today along with a few papers to go along with everything. The Internet setup shows a modem with a telephone line going to it instead of a coax cable.
Is High Speed Internet, cause it looks a lot like DSL to me?

    <ChosenAnswer>DSL IS high speed internet! You got some line filters, but yes it basically just uses your phone line. Don&#039;t confuse DSL with &#039;dial-up&#039; - it&#039;s much faster - up to 10-15MB/s if there is a decent fiber network in your area, but a minimum of 1.5 - 2 MB/s anyway, even over old copper phone lines.</ChosenAnswer>
