            <Content>after the @ symbol is the domain name. The only way i know how to do this would be to own your own domain.</Content>

            <Content>Cola is right. There is no other answer than that :) and i do not think it will be free. 

Register a domain: Once that is done, you can create an email address like domain@domain.com.

If you do find something like this for free then do let us know :). Good Luck!!</Content>

            <Content>You have to get a domain name.  You can get one through godaddy.com or many many others for about 9 dollars a year.  godaddy.com offers email services, or you can use something like google apps that is free.

once you buy a domain name, they can help you set it up to work with email, but basically you have to add a name and c name records to get email working.

I suggest google apps.  I use it, and love it.  its free, only costs me 9 bucks a year for the domain name through godaddy.com</Content>
