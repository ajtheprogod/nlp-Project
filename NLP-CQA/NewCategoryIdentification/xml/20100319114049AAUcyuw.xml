    <ChosenAnswer>ship that sh** yourself, i use to use method to print up label, but i just sold it, wrote out my own label, and shipped hehe =) i beat the ebay system there for your not wasting like 15 dollars to shipp a book, and u still charge them for shipping so you make bigger profit. i started selling large items and the shipping ran me lik 80 bucks, so one day i recieved a package from ebay and im like wait this isnt a ebay  shipping label, so i decided to make my own never got in trouble, once he leaves you feedback after a couple of weeks it will appear that u shipped it, but usually if u ship it without printing label, the shipping, printing label will not be high lighted meaning you didnt print label. but it will go away in a few weeks =A)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I would do media mail. 
This is specifically designed for books, cd&#039;s, vhs, etc. 
It is cheap, efficient, and similar to a flat rate. 

The only drawback is that those packages are inspected more often to make sure that people aren&#039;t shipping items that do not fit these specs.  But if you are shipping within the guidelines, should be no problem. 

Here&#039;s a link to more information:
