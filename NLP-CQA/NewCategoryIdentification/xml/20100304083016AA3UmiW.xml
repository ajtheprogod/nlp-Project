Do other websites work?  If so, then the internet isn&#039;t the problem; that particular web page is.

If no sites work, try unplugging the power to your modem (and router, if you&#039;ve got one) from the wall for about a minute, then plug them back in and give them a minute to reboot.  If that doesn&#039;t work, unplug the ethernet cable from your computer for a minute or two and plug that back in.  If neither of those things work, call tech support.</ChosenAnswer>
