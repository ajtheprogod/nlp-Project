    <ChosenAnswer>Tudou.com is a good streaming website for download. Try it after a few days. It&#039;s not currently there. But, there&#039;s some more oscar Nominated movies like An Education, The Hurt Locker... Try it.

You&#039;ll have to go to Clipnabber.com to download links to the videos.

Hope it helps.</ChosenAnswer>
