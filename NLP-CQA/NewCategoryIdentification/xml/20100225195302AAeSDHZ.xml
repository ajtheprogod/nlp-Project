    <ChosenAnswer>If your Twitter account is set to Private, only those who you allow to follow you will see your tweets. For example, I have a public account and you start following me but I don&#039;t follow you back and you have a private account. You are able to see my tweets but I&#039;m not able to see yours unless I start following you and you accept me. Hope I didn&#039;t confuse you. lol</ChosenAnswer>
