    <ChosenAnswer>Yes it will. Your router will only be able to handle data streaming of sending and receiving at a certain rate. If the bandwidth is filled up, you will notice a drop in connection speed, as it&#039;s being split between multiple connections.

However, this is only really true if all of the connected computers are trying to use the connection at the same time. I.E.: Surfing the web, browsing youtube, playing online games.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It depends on what they are doing. If they are all just viewing static web pages, then you won&#039;t notice. If one or more person is doing something data intensive, like streaming a video or downloading something, then yeah.</Content>
