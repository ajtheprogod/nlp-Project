    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s just like when you want to buy something from eBay.  You go to their feedback and see what people say.  In this case, you look at what comments people have made about the download.

Typically something that is seeded a lot is something that is virus free.  Likewise, many anti-virus programs will try to tell you that the item you downloaded has a virus, especially if it is software.  Usually this is a false alarm, however, you have to use discretion when you download something, make sure it is a trusted person.  A trusted user is silvani.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If you download something from a trusted person the chances of getting a virus is virtually zero. And yes, if you download something and you have an antivirus you will get rid of the virus before it infects your computer</Content>

            <Content>Trusted person?  What, do you know the person?  Do you know all the other people too that you would be pulling bits and pieces of the file from as well? You need to research how torrents work first.  

And seriously if your downloading anything from a &quot;Trusted person&quot; then why the heck would you think you could get a virus?  Obviously they are not &quot;trusted&quot; if you feel that there is a chance to get a virus....your questions are silly.</Content>
