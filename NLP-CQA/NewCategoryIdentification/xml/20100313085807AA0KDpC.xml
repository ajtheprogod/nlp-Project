  <Question id="20100313085807AA0KDpC" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Which sites can &quot;figure out&quot; what country you are in...?</Subject>
    <Content>I mean some sites on the net seem to automatically &quot;know&quot; your country when you register, others don&#039;t... What does it depend on and can I &quot;fool&quot; them claiming that I&#039;m in, say, US, while in reality I&#039;m in UK?

thanks
ok,then why do they ask your country when you edit your profile??  :/
