    <ChosenAnswer>FireFox is under constant maintenance....that is the reason why all you listed problems are coming up...
Anyways....browsers like Opera and Chrome are good...Safari has also been a good option...After IE and Firefox..Opera Chrome and Safari are the best remaining options...
Still firefox is under way...once the maintenance part is over it will regain its glory.....and ya in some time IE 9 is also coming up..do check that out too!!!</ChosenAnswer>
