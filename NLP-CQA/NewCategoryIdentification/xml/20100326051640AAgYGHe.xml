        <Answer>
            <Content>The very 1st was in fact WorldWideWeb, by Tim Berners-Lee, 1991. At that time it was the only way to access the internet. This was followed in 1993 by NCSA Mosaic. Though it&#039;s true to say that the netscape Navigator was the one that was the 1st to be widely used.</Content>
            <Reference>Edit: we are not all wrong! NCSA Mosaic was based on the WorldWideWeb original. Do your research, Glenn. 

&quot;The history of the web browser dates back in to the late 1980s, when a variety of technologies laid the foundation for the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. That browser brought together a variety of existing and new software and hardware technologies.&quot;

            <Content>It was the world wide web, but the answer you may be looking for is Mosaic or Opera, both of those were considered the first main stream browsers.  Mosaic came first and Opera about a year later</Content>
