  <Question id="20100320010014AA30de4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>IP Address issue, help?</Subject>
    <Content>Alright, so i teamviewed my girlfriend, controlled her computer from mine, i dont know if shes saying the truth or not, but she claims she is at Laredo Texas now to visit me, but its been a while she still doesnt even come to my house bringing a lot of reasons to not come and im starting to think shes making this up, so anyways i teamviewed my girlfriend and checked her IP address just to see her location and it says shes in Florida (where she lives) my question is, does whatismyipaddress.com take a while to update the real ip or something? by the way, she is on a laptop, and im extremely curious where shes really at.
