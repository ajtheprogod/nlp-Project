  <Question id="20100302014020AAACzPj" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does anyone know what coat Shutterfly&#039;s Splint gives your horse on Howrse?</Subject>
    <Content>Hey!

The question is pretty self explanatory for people who will know the answer.  I&#039;m just curious because I don&#039;t want to buy it and it to be a coat I don&#039;t like.

If you could please describe it, or send a link for a picture please?  That would be great!  Thanks! : )
