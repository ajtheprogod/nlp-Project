  <Question id="20100321171759AAu2ggV" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why is my Internet connection slow?</Subject>
    <Content>I have roadrunner high-speed Internet with turbo boost (not sure if the last bit matters). Repeatedly throughout the day, I have to reset my connection (both modem and router). My download speed will range from 350 kb until it falls to around 25 kb, upon which I reset the connection. When I&#039;m playing on xbox live after I reset my connection I will host a few games, but after a few hours I will be lagging horribly. I&#039;m looking for help and advice on how I can maintain that high speed I have after I reset the connection. And hopefully improve my overall connection.if there is any other info i need to provide, I will do my best to get it. Any help or advice would be very much appreciated. Thanks!
I have at most running at one time: two iPod touches, a desktop, and my xbox. Although, I almost never have it all on at once.
