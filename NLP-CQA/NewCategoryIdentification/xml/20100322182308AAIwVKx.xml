  <Question id="20100322182308AAIwVKx" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Has anyone really gotten a job thru the Internet?</Subject>
    <Content>I would like to know if people have gotten a job thru the Internet?  I mean, has anyone here applied for a job online and gotten hired thanks to it?  I have applied numerous times for the last month or so, and, I haven&#039;t received any legit (real) phone calls from jobs.  The only ones I have received so far have been from telemarketing companies wanting to know if I am interested in working for them.  They got my personal info from resumes I have posted online.  Has anyone gotten a positive experience by looking for a job online at all?

            <Content>Sure, in fact most of the people we hire start that way. We require all people to apply through the online systems and we are a large company.

If you are talking about posting to monster.com and such, yes, I&#039;ve gotten several positive responses based on my experience. Didn&#039;t get hired because I applied and was hired by my new company.

It really depends on what industry you are in, what skills you have and what type of job you are looking for.</Content>
