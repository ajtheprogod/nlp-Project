  <Question id="20100316213714AAfwd3c" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I have a question about Tumblr/Tumblogs?</Subject>
    <Content>I have 2 tumblogs.
I don&#039;t use the 1st one like, at all. My second one, however is pretty popular, and I keep up with it well. I know I can&#039;t delete my 1st one without loosing my 2nd one, so I&#039;m trying to get around this.
Could I change the name of my first one to the second one, and then delete the second one?
like Change blog A&#039;s name to blog B, then delete blog B.
What would be the cons of this?

            <Content>No you cannot at this time.

(From the Tumblr FAQ page):
Can I change which blog is the default blog for my account? Can I transfer a default blog to another account? Can I delete my default blog?
Changing the default blog or moving a default blog to another account are not possible at this time. And, you cannot delete the default blog without deleting your entire Tumblr account.</Content>
