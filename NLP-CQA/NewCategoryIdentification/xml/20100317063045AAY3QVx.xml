  <Question id="20100317063045AAY3QVx" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Have you received spam or infected e-mails when listing items on Craigslist?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a couple items listed on Craigslist. I have received several e-mails expressing interest. But so far all of them have had links or attachments the sender wanted me to open. (I haven&#039;t opened any of them.) How likely is it that all of these e-mails are infected with some sort of virus? I&#039;m trying to decide if these people are truly interested or if they&#039;re just trying to hack into my computer.

    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s spam. Someone who is interested in your items will not send YOU a link to something else. 

Then you get the ones who look legit, write after you respond, &quot;Thanks I will be mailing you a check for the amount you indicated and have my movers pick up the items from your location...&quot; yadda yadda yadda. 

Sometimes its not worth the hassle.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Its an ever increasing problem on craigslist. People want you to purchase or sign up or go to there site to view there crap. Never open an attachment or go to link if the person sending isnt 100 % trustworthy. Im tired of all the Obama programs that enable you to keep your items, because there is a program to help you out. Basically they take your cash and leave you hanging. If its not a true inquiry to what your selling, just delete.</Content>

            <Content>they are spam people are sending you and may also be a virus. There is no reason to send you attachments  to buy a item. Delete them and move on. I HATE those things. I get them too  and i dont use craigslist anymore because of them</Content>
