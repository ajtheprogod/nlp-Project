    <ChosenAnswer>All right as to shipping via Air then ground (years ago one could joke as to the &quot;Slow Boat From China&quot;. In this case as to shipping details the most would be 14 days. However I would have thought that it should be there by now as this is not the height of the shipping season.

So by way of ground 4 weeks, by air 2 to 4 weeks so it has been only 10 days.</ChosenAnswer>
