    <Subject>What can we do to make our connection better?</Subject>
    <Content>Im not sure what type of connection we have but it has a cable that plugs into a router. My brothers and I would like to play Xbox live with each other but each time one us receives &#039;Cannot connect&#039; or &#039; Lost connection&#039;. I was thinking about maybe a better router will make it better but I don&#039;t know. What can we do to make our connection better?
