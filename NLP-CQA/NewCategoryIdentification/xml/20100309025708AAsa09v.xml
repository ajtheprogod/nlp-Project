    <ChosenAnswer>I was using auctionstealer.com but found gixen.com to be better, totally free to use. Reliable  it hasnt let me down ever, places the bid with 5 seconds to go (whereas auctionstealer was 15 secs)
Easy to use.  Just enter your ebay user id &amp; password, enter the item number, your max bid, confirm. All too easy.</ChosenAnswer>
