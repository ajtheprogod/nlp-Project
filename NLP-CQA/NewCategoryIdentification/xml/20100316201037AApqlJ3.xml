    <ChosenAnswer>Well, I&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t have windows Vista/Win7 because those come with it by default. So I think you have XP or lower. That said you&#039;ll need to install them or activate them if they have not yet been turned on.

I had the same problem, on XP it would just show or something very simular. So I found a site(one I can&#039;t recall, google &quot;Language installation packages&quot;) and I installed my asian language (Japanese). Though I do recall XP may not recognize it at first, so try using the links below.

Hope I helped. :D</ChosenAnswer>
