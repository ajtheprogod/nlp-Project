    <ChosenAnswer>Well I did a bit of research, and there doesn&#039;t seem to be a general directory of important email addresses. Probably to avoid spam. Spammers create lists of mostly guessed emails. Imagine if they could just get a list available on the web.

In general, most websites have a &quot;contact us/me&quot; somewhere on their site. Most likely at the very bottom. For instance: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/first_appeal.html

That form sends an email to one of the staff members in the appeal department. Or whatever they call it.</ChosenAnswer>
