    <ChosenAnswer>You only have the URL from where you are downloading from which is the source site.

As regards addresses it depends on how it is routed through the various nodes on the internet.

Even a mirror site can route differently from another.

If there is a problem with a node you are immediately rerouted through another system.

You need to get yourself a ping or trace program if you are really that keen to know.</ChosenAnswer>
