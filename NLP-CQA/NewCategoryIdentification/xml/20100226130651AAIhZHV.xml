    <Subject>What is streaming? Help?</Subject>
    <Content>Im interested in a wifi radio and I read that: &quot;Before purchasing, it&#039;s best to become familiar with how streaming audio works on their website. You will need to purchase Internet streaming ability from Sirius in addition to your radio account. Be sure this is all working first.&quot;
What does it mean?
