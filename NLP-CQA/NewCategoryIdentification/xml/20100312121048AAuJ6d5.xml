Add-ons (or in Mozilla called Extensions) are like gadgets that you add to your browser to help you with stuff, like one called Video Download Helper for instance, that when you install enables you to download Youtube videos directly to your computer, other add-ons there are stuff that change the look of your browser, help you sort your bookmarks, and much more...

            <Content>As a fervent Firefox user, let me just say that if you are screwing up your computer by just switching browsers, use Google Chrome. It&#039;s designed for people who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing.</Content>

            <Content>I think that addons are either downloadable software that you add to your computer.  But, in other ways, addsons and plugins can be extensions that you add on, like a gigabyte memory stick or the plugin or a speaker system, and so on.  

Even though my friends use mozilla firefox and they like it, I try to stay away from it as much as possible.  I think Internet Explorer is probably the best web server.</Content>
