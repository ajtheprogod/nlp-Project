    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;ve never heard of it... but a google search showed something about MP3s and music.

If you&#039;re looking to just listen to music while you&#039;re online, check out http://www.grooveshark.com/ It&#039;s pretty easy to use and it has a HUGE library of songs.

If you&#039;re looking to download MP3s, I&#039;d buy them. But if you need to try out the full mp3 on your computer first ;) try http://www.emp3world.com/

They&#039;re both search-based, so you should know what song you want before going there. If you want to discover music, try pandora or last.fm.

Hope this helps!
