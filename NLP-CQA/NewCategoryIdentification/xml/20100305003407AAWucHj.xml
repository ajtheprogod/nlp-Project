    <ChosenAnswer>By copying the whole thing yes you can get in trouble, taking a few points and giving credit to the source might maybe be okay but your best bet would be to get the permission from the original author for anything you want to use that someone else wrote! (and get permission before you use it not after) Also i think it all depends on what your using.
My advice = don&#039;t copy other people&#039;s work in any way or form!!!
Hope that can help a bit ;-)</ChosenAnswer>
