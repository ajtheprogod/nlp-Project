    <ChosenAnswer>Looks like he is circumventing ebay fees by charging an absolute fortune in postage costs (the info relating to the points is in a email!!).If ebay find out they will pull his auctions..only a matter of time....
Anyway back to your question, Going by the feedback it appears previous buyers have been happy with their purchases of these points so its up to you.  Im not going to give you a lecture in whats right or wrong but yeah you get what Im saying</ChosenAnswer>
