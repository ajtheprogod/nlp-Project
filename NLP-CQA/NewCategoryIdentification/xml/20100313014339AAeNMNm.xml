    <Subject>Browser doesn&#039;t load (5mins broken-5 mins works-...) while I do have internet connection?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m having this problem for a pretty long time now. Any browser I try can&#039;t load any pages during some time (usually +-5 min). After that it runs fine for about 5 mins and then stops loading any new page for another period of +-5 min, this cycle keeps repeating.

I do have internet connections in the moments the browsers are not working (I can talk to people on msn messenger etc).

Anyone got any idea on how to solve this?

tried these browsers (all are running and down at same periods of time): IE, firefox, chrome, cometbird

its not my overall speed thats bad, its periods it doesnt work at all and periods it works really good

            <Content>it&#039;s ur connection. You probably don&#039;t have high speed internet that&#039;s why it is taking that long to load. If you are under a router then maybe it is because your. Router is too far from your computer.</Content>

            <Content>I&#039;d try an IP release first or try flushing your DNS.

I&#039;d then try resetting my router completely. You can do this by pushing in the little button on the back and holding it in for 10-30 seconds.

I was going to say try clearing the cache, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;d fix the issue. However, might as well to get all the old pages out.</Content>
