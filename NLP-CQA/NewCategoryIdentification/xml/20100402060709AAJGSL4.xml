The link is to a malware program. I&#039;ve run it through a scan and it appears to be a keylogger and possibly more.

I&#039;ve reported him to Yahoo and I&#039;m hoping they&#039;re turn his information over to the FBI, but he&#039;s probably a foreigner outside of US jurisdiction.</ChosenAnswer>
