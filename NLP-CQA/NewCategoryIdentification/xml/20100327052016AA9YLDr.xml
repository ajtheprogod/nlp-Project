    <ChosenAnswer>If you are trying to download anything while there is an updating going on; the download speed will be very low.Change the automatic update to manual update in Your antivirus(k7) settings.
Your download speed will improve.Moreover you can never get the exact speed specified by the company because the internet connection supply speed depends on various factors like distance,
system config etc.But try this: Change automatic update settings to manual for any software on your system.Also there are softwares like speed bit that can increase download speed.</ChosenAnswer>
