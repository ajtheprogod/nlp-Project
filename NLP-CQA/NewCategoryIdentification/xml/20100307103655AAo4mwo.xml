    <ChosenAnswer>I can&#039;t tell you if there is one but i can tell you that I registred with them and 6 wks later an invite came through. I know its not much help but at least you know that you may get one before summer.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Nope. You need to get it from another Spotify member.

EDIT: I&#039;ll need an email address to send it to you on (if you want me 2).</Content>
