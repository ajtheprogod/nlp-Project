    <ChosenAnswer>That sounds about like something a stupid computer will tell you. Every morning when I sign on, my computer says, here&#039;s that idiot at my keyboard again. I wonder what he is going to have me screw up today. LOL  I don&#039;t know what version of firefox you have, I had 3.5 and a little while ago I upgraded to 3.6 that might solve your problem, if you don&#039;t already have that. I guess it would be worth a try. Whatever you think.
You do know that some of those add on&#039;s are for older versions of firefox.  (Look on the right side.)</ChosenAnswer>
