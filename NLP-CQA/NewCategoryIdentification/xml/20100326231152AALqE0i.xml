  <Question id="20100326231152AALqE0i" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What happens if you buy something on eBay and don&#039;t pay for it?</Subject>
    <Content>I bought some retarded wooden box from some company or someone in Japan. I ended up winning the bid for $6.99. I bid on it in the middle of the night and idk what I was thinking but it&#039;s ugly as heck and shipping on it is absolutely ridiculous! Super high! I know it&#039;s my fault for doing it in the first place, so no lectures please. But I won the bid a couple days ago and still haven&#039;t paid for it....What happens if I just don&#039;t?

Contact the seller &amp; ask to withdraw from the sale. They dont have to agree to this, if they dont agree they will open a non paying bidder dispute &amp; if it remains unpaid will issue you a strike. This could restrict you in the future re bidding/selling. Get 3 strikes &amp; ebay will terminate your account.

Sellers cannot give neg feedback to buyers anymore. 

No lectures I promise but as a ebay seller myself, it takes time &amp; money to list things then to have someone change their mind for whatever reason its a bit annoying. Anyway just communicate with the seller, they may just cancel the sale, with no penalty to you.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>They&#039;ll give you negative feedback for not paying of course. You possibly could be fined as well.

Just pay for the item &amp; avoid possible legal hassles.

            <Content>You will definitely get negative feedback, which is never a good thing unless you have like 12,565 feedback because instead of 100% it would look something like 98.7% or 99.9%. You could have your account suspended also if you don&#039;t pay. Just talk to the seller about it and see if they will allow you to do a bid retraction and avoid any problems.</Content>
