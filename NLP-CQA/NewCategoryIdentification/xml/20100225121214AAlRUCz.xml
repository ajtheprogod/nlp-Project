    <Subject>What are some benefits of pirating music and movies?</Subject>
    <Content>Im writing a research paper. I want to do it on how the American copyright laws are unjust and should be removed. I can&#039;t come up with any ideas, so answers, if you have any reasons why those copyright laws and DRMs (Digital rights management) need to be removed.

        <Answer>
            <Content>You can&#039;t come up with any reasons because there aren&#039;t any good ones. Why would people create music and movies and put all the time, money, and effort into it if they&#039;re not going to profit off of it? If I go to work, I&#039;m going to get paid for it. Actors, musicians, writers, directors, producers, etc all would like to get paid for their work. Go figure. They don&#039;t want random people stealing it and profiting on their work. 

I think you might want to try a different angle on your paper.</Content>
