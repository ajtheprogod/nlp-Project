  <Question id="20100326083021AAAaOiC" type="Answered">
    <Subject>any Ideas for blog title?</Subject>
    <Content>My blog will be anonymous, it will cover the troubles of a 20 something woman, struggling with daily troubles and of course there is always men and sex involved. It will not be shallow it will go from everything to clothes, rants about men, weekly epiphanies and outstanding occurences. 

I honestly cannot think of a clever title that will attract readers and promote the intellegence behind it.

    <ChosenAnswer>How about &quot;Girl About Town&quot;. 

Having said that, I think you if you want to promote intelligence, you should improve your spelling. In your short question there are two spelling mistakes. 

I would try looking up the following two words of yours!

occurences
