    <Subject>My firefox browser isnt working properly and I&quot;m not sure what to do?</Subject>
    <Content>When I log on to the web, my browser only allows certain pages to load such as facebook. However If I try to log on to myspace or person or youtube my browser takes forever and then it never loads the page. What could be the problem?
Oh I also just  updated my firefox about an hour ago. And I have to parental restrictions on my computer, also it was working fine this afternoon.

            <Content>did you or someone block certain sites are the parental restrictions in use?  If so you need to ask the person who installs things.

maybe you need to uninstall the old version. use a clean up utility like COMODO  
then install a new version</Content>
