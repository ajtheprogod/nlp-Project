    <ChosenAnswer>Webs.com is a free service which allows to create web sites simply for those who does not know anything about web development.

Their free service is very basic. however even the paid service is not flexible.

If you want a real web site, I would suggest you to get a web host and develop your site from CMS like Wordpress / Drupal or from Scratch!</ChosenAnswer>
