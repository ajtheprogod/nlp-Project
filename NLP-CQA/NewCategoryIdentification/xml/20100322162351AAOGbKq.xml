  <Question id="20100322162351AAOGbKq" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Find an online library?</Subject>
    <Content>Is there a website I can go to that is just like a library? I sign up, maybe pay a shipping fee (I would prefer it to be free but I know I probably can&#039;t get away with that), and order books that can be sent to my home? Then, of course, I send them back when they are do. 

I was just wondering if there was anything like this?

    <ChosenAnswer>I don&#039;t know of a site like that.

I do know that sometimes people treat Amazon.com like that, though. You can buy a book, read it, and sell it again as &#039;used&#039; after you&#039;re done with it. You can keep the book as long as you&#039;d like, and you can sell it for however much you want. There&#039;s no subscription fee or anything.

You can also buy a bunch of other things at Amazon, too.
