    <ChosenAnswer>There is a great piece of free software called MPEG Streamclip..
You can download it from here:
http://www.squared5.com/svideo/mpeg-streamclip-mac.html
or from Apple&#039;s software downloads.
Most serious mac users have this software on their computers.
Download the beta version - 1.9.3b2 and install, then open.
Now just drag your video file into the main window.
(If you want to convert YouTube clips, click on File &gt; Open URL... and copy/ paste the YouTube clip address in, then click Open).
Once the clip has loaded, click File &gt; Export to QuickTime.
From the first box (Compression) choose Apple Intermediate Codec.
Leave all the others setting alone.
Choose a destination then when it&#039;s converted, open iMovie and File &gt; Import &gt; Movies and navigate to where you saved your file (desktop ?).
Regards, Zyfert

PS I would rename your file to take out the underscores:  _
Sometimes these sorts of symbols can upset things.</ChosenAnswer>
