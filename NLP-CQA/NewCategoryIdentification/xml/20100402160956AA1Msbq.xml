  <Question id="20100402160956AA1Msbq" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can anyone recommend a good adult webcam company to work for?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve been looking into livejasmin.com and onhercam.com. I want to only do non-nude and maybe flash my boobs but no vag. I know that there are a lot of trashy girls that work these companies and I just want to work for a company that pays well (higher percentage payout) and has a lot of traffic at their site. I know some of them require approval, I&#039;m 27 years old 5&#039;7&quot; 125 lbs.

If anyone has any other recommendations for other sites please let me know. Also, any tips from webcam girls are greatly appreciated. =) Thanks!
For people who like to judge: I have applied for all of the jobs in my local newspaper and every online job search engine available. If it&#039;s a choice between having my electricity shut off, being homeless, etc. then I will do what I have to do. All moms would probably do the same if they had no other option.

If you don&#039;t have a real answer - don&#039;t answer!

    <ChosenAnswer>I think I just answered one of your questions and sent you a link to livejasmin. All sites that I know of will require approval. When looking for sites with high traffic I think LJ is the way to go. They aggressively market their sites and have an aggressive network of affiliates sending them a lot of traffic.

There are also sites like myfreecams.com where you can get tips from viewers in the free chat areas, but it&#039;s very hard to get a private chat and most of the viewers seem to be people begging for a free peek. On MFC you&#039;ll also be competing with a bunch of models who get completely naked in the free area, so it would be hard to compete with them just doing a flash here and there.</ChosenAnswer>
