    <ChosenAnswer>Not sure what you questions is.  Are you asking the average amount of time it takes to create and maintain a travel blog?  The answer to that question is it&#039;s entirely up to you.  I can spend 3 hours a day working on my blog or I can spend 1 hour on the blog and 2 hours on promoting it.  To get your blog off the ground I would suggest at least 10 hours a week to start.

Or are you asking what is the average amount of time a visitor spends on a travel blog?  Depends on how good the content is and how engaged the author makes the reader.  If you are familiar with bounce rates, I always suggest trying to get your bounce rate below 70%.  I have blogs where the average visit time is less than 30 sec and other blogs where the average visit time is over 5 minutes.
