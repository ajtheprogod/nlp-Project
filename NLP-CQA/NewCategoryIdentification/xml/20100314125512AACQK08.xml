    <ChosenAnswer>Depends on what&#039;s available in your area.  If you want to go super cheap, Net Zero does dial up for free.  I think you get about 10 hours a month and then they charge you 10 bucks.  But dial up sucks...  Look for a good DSL provider.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>So I take it you&#039;re from Boston? 

It depends very much on what part of the state you live, if you&#039;re really in Massachusetts, but Charter, Comcast and Verizon all have service in parts of Boston and other locations in Massachusetts. 

Otherwise you need to tell us where you live, since I&quot;m just guessing based on your stereotypical Bostonian choice of idiomatic expressions.

EDIT: Arizona is a large state. We can&#039;t tell you which ISPs are available to you without knowing your apartment number, building number, street address and city. Comcast services regions in Arizona, but I don&#039;t know if Comcast would service you, in particular, or not, nor do I know if it would be cheaper than Cox.

The only way to find out for certain if you can get service from a particular ISP or not is to call that ISP via telephone or possibly via post. An ISP may service your region and even your street, but that doesn&#039;t mean they will serve every building on that street. Therefore, it&#039;s more or less something that you have to do on your own, since most of us probably don&#039;t want to give away our street address on the Internet.</Content>
