    <ChosenAnswer>On Windows you hit Control+J to open the download manager and there should be a button at the bottom to clear the list. Maybe MAC version works different.

I don&#039;t have a MAC but I find this is the easiest way on Windows to keep the download manager clean.

In the address bar for Firefox type:

about:config

and press enter.

You&#039;ll have a page full of text.
In the filter box at the top type:

browser.download.manager.retention

you should see the entry pop up as you type.
Double click the entry. The current value should be set to 2. Change it to 1 and click Okay.

Now every time you close Firefox it will clear the download manager.

Edit: Looking back on it, it almost seems like you are asking if you can somehow delete the downloaded file itself from the Firefox download window. If this is the case, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve ever seen an extension to do this.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Try OnyX to delete all your temporary downloaded files ( which in fact the contents of download window are the same).

You can download it from (http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/20070)

and there are also many other Optimization Softwares for Mac : Look at here (http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/systemutilities/maintenance-optimization)

Good Luck</Content>
