    <Subject>Favorites folder/sub folder missing in IE?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m not sure how and what happened but when I pull up the favorites I&#039;m missing an entire folder and sub folder with many saved sites/bookmarks. This is in Internet Explorer. Some of the favorites not in a separate folder still appear but everything else is gone especially the folders I need. I checked the recycle bin which was empty and then attempted a system restore which didn&#039;t help. I really need to locate these files. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
I tried doing a system restore a few times each time going back further on the date. Still the folder doesn&#039;t appear. I also tried going into the c/documnet/favorite folder. It&#039;s almost like my folder was either deleted from the system or didn&#039;t exist. Anything else I can try?

    <ChosenAnswer>Try doing a system restore. On the bottom toolbar, click &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;All Programs&quot;, &quot;Accessories&quot;, &quot;System Tools&quot;, &quot;System Restore&quot;. In the pop-up window, select &quot;Restore My System To An Earlier Time&quot; then click &quot;Next&quot;. Hopefully there will be an available (bold text) date highlighted, pick one when you know the favorites folder was still on your computer, then hit &quot;Next&quot; then &quot;Next&quot; again. Should restore the folder, If not, try an earlier restore date.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Try this:
C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;your login account&gt;\Favorites\
This is where IE bookmarks are kept.
If you can&#039;t find them there, you will have to go through your Internet history to restore your favorites</Content>
