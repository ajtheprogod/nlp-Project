  <Question id="20100311192354AAnlSux" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What do you think of MLIA (my life is average)?</Subject>
    <Content>I think its funny but too many harry potter, fort building six year old stories.  I mean those stories are funny at first but sometimes MLIA seems to repeat itself with those stories.

    <ChosenAnswer>Yeah I agree with you. I use to read it a lot, but now I prefer FML (fmylife.com) cause its more entertaining. MLIA is all about Harry Potter, Ninjas, etc, and doesn&#039;t really portray &quot;Average&quot; lives anymore; there are only a few good ones I really like. Once in a while I&#039;ll take a look, but every time I mainly see the same stuff.
