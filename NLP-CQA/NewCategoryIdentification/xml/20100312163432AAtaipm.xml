    <Subject>Is it possible to catch a computer hacker?</Subject>
    <Content>My friends and I play MapleStory and yesterday they got attacked by a hacker (I was not online). At first they thought it was just in the game, but they logged off and their computers were infected. One of my friends noticed that her webcam had turned on and &quot;ghost chat&quot; had opened up. She disconnected her internet in panic and it was all gone. Now they want to catch the hacker and they asked me to help. However, I don&#039;t think this is possible. They were talking about getting his IP address and turning him in to the police, but I&#039;m pretty sure you need to download some sort of a program for that, which is probably illegal. I also researched ghost chat and it&#039;s just some online forum where people talk about, well, ghosts. So, anybody with computer experience, if it&#039;s possible to get this hacker, how do we do it?

    <ChosenAnswer>Yes.

It depends on how good the hacker is of course. The best hackers never get caught, on the other hand a part time &quot;script kiddie&quot; is probably quite easy to catch. 

Either way, it&#039;s not something you can do without a firm understanding of computer security and cooperation with the appropriate authorities.</ChosenAnswer>
