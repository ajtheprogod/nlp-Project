  <Question id="20100302072252AAvsNvB" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Please help! Any answers quickly! Why isn&#039;t my attachment sending on gmail? How do I get it to the other comp?</Subject>
    <Content>I have to send my school project to another computer so I can finish it. It&#039;s a video I made in windows movie maker, and it&#039;s due tomorrow. Anyway, whenever I attach the file to an email on gmail it sends the email, but not the file even though it says it&#039;s attached. I attach the file, send it, then when I go look on the other computer (on gmail) I have the email just not the &quot;attached&quot; file. I have the latest version of flash. I have the attachment settings on basic (it won&#039;t send it on advanced). The computer I want to open it on has windows movie maker, if that makes a difference. Please help, I really need to finish it, I&#039;m starting to panic. And also, I tried one of those websites where you can upload files, but it wouldn&#039;t upload for some reason. Please help!!! Any answers apreciated! And I don&#039;t have a flash drive for this (which would make this a lot easier).
Yes, the computers are on the same network.

    <ChosenAnswer>Are the computers on the same network?

Computer A = the one that has the file
Computer B = the other one

Go to Computer A and click on Start | Run then type in CMD
You will get a DOS window. Type in &quot;ipconfig&quot; and press enter
Find the IP address for this machine... it will probably look something like 192.168.1.57

Go to Computer B and click on Start | Run then type in &quot;\\TheIpAddressOfComputerA\C$&quot; and press enter.
So for the example IP I gave you before it would be &quot;\\192.168.1.57\C$&quot;

You will get a prompt for a user name and password. Use the username and password that you would normally use to log in to Computer A

If it all works you will be looking at Computer A&#039;s hard drive and you can just copy the file from where ever you had it to where ever you want it to be on the new computer.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Have some coffee Jennifer,
Gmail does not accept files larger as 20Mb (was 10Mb) and no zipped files nor the extentions that could be viruses like: .exe .bat and .com. Due to copyright infringement  they may not accept movie files either. Solution is: rename the extension to something not existing.

Your other solution may not work while the file is still being processed and moderated.</Content>
