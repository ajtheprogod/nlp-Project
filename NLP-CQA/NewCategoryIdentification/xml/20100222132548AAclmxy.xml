    <Subject>Who knows where I can watch Firefly online for free?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m looking for a website that has the second episode of Firefly. I was too young to appreciate it when it was on TV, and now I&#039;m looking for it online. If someone could just give me the link to s01 e02 (&#039;The Train Job&#039;) that I could go to to watch it online without downloading it, that would be great.

    <ChosenAnswer>If you&#039;re willing to wait, Hulu&#039;s going to have more of the series available to watch online soon.

Also, there&#039;s got to be someone around you know who&#039;s got the DVDs. I know you can buy the whole 14-episode run of the show for under $20.</ChosenAnswer>
