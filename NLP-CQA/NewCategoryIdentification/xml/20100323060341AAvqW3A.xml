  <Question id="20100323060341AAvqW3A" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I have lost my go back button on my toolbar along with not being able to right click to see the view button?</Subject>
    <Content>I was messing around with my options when I deleted my go back and forward buttons. All I have now showing is most visited, getting started, latest headlines, free hotmail, suggested sites, and web slice gallery. How do I restore my options I had before? I tried reinstalling firefox but it still does not show up. Help, I will give out max points for this. Thanks
I go up to where my buttons should be at and right clicked all over but no luck. Also do not see anything with tools either. Help

    <ChosenAnswer>On your tool bar, maybe the far right, look for the word &quot;Tools&quot; and the black down arrow, Click on it and go down to &quot;Tool Bars&quot; and click on them and see what happens. That will probably bring it back.</ChosenAnswer>
