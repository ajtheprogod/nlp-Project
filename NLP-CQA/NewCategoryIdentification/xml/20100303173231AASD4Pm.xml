  <Question id="20100303173231AASD4Pm" type="Answered">
    <Subject>any good free web hosting sites?</Subject>
    <Content>I purchased a domain from GoDaddy.  Are there any free web hosting sites I can use to host my site and use the godaddy domain?
I already have the site build, its fairly basic just a few flash pages.  could easily get away with under 1 gig storage.

    <ChosenAnswer>Forget weebly or whatever other so called free hosting where you cannot even install your own web application and do not have access cPanel, PHP or MySQL. 

Here is the real deal, you can get a free web hosting with unlimited bandwidth, unlimited space, unlimited domains, cPanel, Fantastico and much more. Better yet, this is from one of the top 10 web hosting companies - Hostgator.

The catch? You get to use it only for a month :)
