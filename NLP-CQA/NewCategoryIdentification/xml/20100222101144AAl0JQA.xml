    <Subject>What Hughes Net satellite package will I need to use Skype?</Subject>
    <Content>I plan on moving into a cabin completely off the grid in the middle of the woods for about a year.  I would like to stay in contact with my friends and family while there, my cell phone quits working about an hour or two before I even get there so that is no good.  I also want to have internet.  My father told me about Hughes Net Satellite services and Skype.  I have never used either one so I know nothing about either. I don&#039;t know how many Mbps I need to run Skype.  What I am wondering is which Hughes Net package I will need to use Skype and do the video chats?  If anybody can point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it, thanks! :-)

            <Content>Skype will work with any Internet package except Dial-Up
If you mean $199.99 per month, it would seem Americans are grossly overcharged for their Internet packages.
A 20MB package here in UK is just Â£25 per month (US$40)</Content>

            <Content>Skype&#039;s connection usage may vary.

There may be connection problems due to the delay. This may cause skype not to work or not function good using VoIP (at worst) or cause a delay when you speak and they would hear it (at best)

However I can not say for certain what package will do it.</Content>
