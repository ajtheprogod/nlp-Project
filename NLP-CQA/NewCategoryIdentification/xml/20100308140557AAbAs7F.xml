    <ChosenAnswer>None? I must admit I keep Facebook tabbed but I often wonder why. Lots of people I haven&#039;t spoken to in ten years tagging photos of people that I don&#039;t know... Twitter seems so low attention span I can;t get myself to spend more than five minutes on it at a time. I have never even seen Google Buzz. I actually spend most of my time here, for some unknowable reason.</ChosenAnswer>
