    <Subject>Paypal ...money order?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi I would like to take money from my paypal account which is linked to my moms credit card and get some cash in hand today or asap. My mom&#039;s at the hospital so I she can&#039;t do anything. I do not have a bank account so just rule that out okay. What I&#039;m looking to do for example is western union myself the money and pay for it using paypal (except western union doesnt do that.) nor does moneygram. Does anyone know of a service where I can pay online and pickup @ the store? I really just need a few things from the grocery. I&#039;d even buy a safeway gift card or something of that nature online but I cant wait for anything in the mail either so please don&#039;t suggest that. Online service, pay with paypal ----&gt; receive cash in hand... thoughts?
Well I&#039;m trying to be as honest as I can. I assure you the paypal account is mine. And thanks for the answer - dick.

    <ChosenAnswer>This just doesn&#039;t sound legit.  It sounds more like you&#039;ve accessed someones paypal account (possibly your mom&#039;s) and are trying to steal.</ChosenAnswer>
