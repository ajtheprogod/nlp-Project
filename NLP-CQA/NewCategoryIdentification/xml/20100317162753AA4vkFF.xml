    <Subject>Possible to split cable from TV to get internet?</Subject>
    <Content>I know it is possible to split cable internet to TV to get basic cable (while only paying for internet).  Is it possible the other way around?  I would rather pay for a decent cable package and not internet instead of paying for internet and just getting a very basic cable package.  I just know I can&#039;t afford both.

    <ChosenAnswer>No that is not possible. While you can physically split the cable connection, the data/signal coming through the line will not be correct. You need to pay for both services for them to work.</ChosenAnswer>
