    <Content>My friend said to me join linkedin and you can get contacts in the same field as you etc, so I have joined but I am wondering do you add random people or only people you know in real life? and how does it all work?

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi,

LinkedIn is just like facebook only. But Linkedin is more of business perspective than facebook. Similar to facebook , In LinkedIn we create connections but there are other options also like finding jobs, posting jobs etc which are likely not in facebook. You can post all your educational history and job history like your job experience in this which will be visible to all.</ChosenAnswer>
