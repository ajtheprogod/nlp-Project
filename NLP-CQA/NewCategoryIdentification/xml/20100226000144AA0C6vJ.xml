  <Question id="20100226000144AA0C6vJ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>please help with ebay timezones? 10 POINTS!!?</Subject>
    <Content>the thing im going to bid on has exactly 1 day left(24 hours) left but it&#039;s in PST timezone and my timezone is central. so what does this mean exactly??
i was outbid by proxy yesterday and when the time turned to 1 hour, it started counting down on its own(i didnt have to keep refreshing the page, the numbers just automatically counted down on ebay) so i dont know if the person was in a different timezone than me but if they were, would we be seeing the same countdown? 
please help me!!! this is all sooo confusing!
i did a pst to central conversion online. so when the auction ends, pst time will be about 12:00 a.m and central time will be about 2:00 a.m....so does this mean the auction will end at the same &#039;time&#039; but when the auction is ending, it will be 12:00 there and 2:00 here?
