    <ChosenAnswer>I trusted the internet perfectly...until I took my first networking course.  When I didn&#039;t understand it I was content to belive it worked, now that I understand all of it&#039;s layers/protocols/techniques I can&#039;t believe something that complicated can actually work ;)

Honestly though I think I feel more trust with access to the internet then without it.  It&#039;s not so much that I trust the internet, as I trust my ability to screen what I see on the internet.  Not too long ago if I saw something on the news I had to &#039;trust&#039; that what they were saying was true and not being twisted to serve a political agenda.  Now if a politician says something interesting I can get the facts, see how both sides of the political spectrum &#039;interpret&#039; the facts, and make my own conclusion based off of a significant amount of data.

The important part is to realize any single point on the internet can&#039;t be trusted.  You should either 1) check with sites you know can be trusted or 2) get confirmation from multiple sites

Oh and if you get an e-mail, pop-up, friend request ect that seems odd to you, assume it&#039;s a virus until otherwise stated.  Hey trust and paranoia can live side by side!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>While being a great source of information and it has taught me so much, I always double check news or &quot;new&quot; information. I can&#039;t get over how people believe emails from strangers and are so gullible sometimes.</Content>

            <Content>The internet has not been trustworthy since it&#039;s inception.

It can be a valuable tool if used right and after double checking everything.  But to trust it would be folly.</Content>

            <Content>completely mistrusting the internet is not the way to be. everything you do in life can involve a risk or put you in danger. I&#039;d like to think of the internet as no more dangerous than sex because with proper precautions, you&#039;re likely to be ok.
I am cautious but not completely mistrustful. as long as you don&#039;t give out personal info, you avoid websites/email that look suspicious and you have good software to keep your computer from infection you and your computer are likely to be safe.</Content>
