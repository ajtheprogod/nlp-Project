    <ChosenAnswer>You need a router not another modem. Also adding a second modem at  the what ever location to be close to what ever you seek will not speed up the net.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It sounds like you are using a DSL connection. DSL does not work the same way that dial-up worked... you can not have two modems in the same house unless you have a special business account with your service provider.

And on that note.... the reason you have a slow connection is because you are on DSL - it was never made for gaming. Try upgrading your Internet service to cable or fiber.</Content>
