    <ChosenAnswer>What version of Internet Explorer are you using? If you are not running Internet Explorer 8, try downloading it from here: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx?ocid=ie8_sm_a  

If you are running IE8, try enabling compatibility mode. It is the broken page icon next to the refresh button on the toolbar. Here’s a good resource from the IEBlog that talks about compatibility mode in detail if you’d like to learn more: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/02/16/just-the-facts-recap-of-compatibility-view.aspx 

If that doesn’t work, run IE in No Add-ons Mode.  Go to Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) - If this fixes the issue, then go to Tools -&gt; Manage Add-ons and enable the add-ons one by one to find which one was causing the problem. 

You can also try resetting Internet Explorer&#039;s settings by going to Tools &gt; Internet Options and then the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, and click &quot;Reset...&quot; 

I hope this solves your problem!

            <Content>Hello ,

  Remove completely your Antivirus software . You will need to properly remove by using the &quot;Removal Tool&quot; found at the Antivirus Website . Add or Remove Programs will not properly remove . Then install the IE8 again . Right after the IE8 install , be sure to install your Antivirus and run a Full System Scan after updating the Antivirus .</Content>

            <Content>I was going to sugest re-installing IE, you stole my answer!

Have you tried resetting the browser in options to its origonal settings? Although this would do the same as re-installing it...

Not something silly like it has Working Offline ticked? :)

My next option is removing other browsers then removing IE until it is back it IE 6 and see if it works then?

Then I would say hell with it and re-install Windows ;)</Content>

            <Content>Mine isn&#039;t working either.
My computer made me upgrade my windows through Microsoft genuine or something.
before that my internet explorer wouldn&#039;t even open.
Now it opens, but when i type in an address it won&#039;t load and it gets frozen.
I&#039;m using Firefox right now too.

It sucks.</Content>

            <Content>Did you use an antifilter or proxy ? If it is so, try to change your proxy settings from Tools | Internet Options| Connections| settings. In the &quot;settings&quot; dialog box, remove the tick from &quot;proxy server&quot; check box. Then click OK and try to use IE again.</Content>
