    <ChosenAnswer>hi john, depends on the site you are trying to access, there server may be down, if you are getting the message &quot;unable to connect to this site&quot; this is probably the cause and there is nothing that you can do to fix this. other wise you may need to lower your security settings But this I do not encourage as this is bad for your computer. just keep trying.
Hope this helps.</ChosenAnswer>
