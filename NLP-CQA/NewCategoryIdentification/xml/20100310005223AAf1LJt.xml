    <ChosenAnswer>No. Lockerz have redemptions once a month. There not announced and last only about 30sec. Its possible but very difficult to get a good prize. 

Just a suggestion if looking for another free prize winning site. Swagbucks! Prizes are always in stock and anyone can win them. Swagbucks is just a search engine like google, but you randomly win swagbucks for searching the web. Theres other ways of getting bucks too! I usually buy amazon.com gift cards. Ive made over $100 in alittle time. Try it out-             http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</ChosenAnswer>
