    <ChosenAnswer>haha he can&#039;t do anything
first ask him to show you the proof that he sent you (which he obviously doesn&#039;t)
secondly he can only involve paypal; they will check if you recieved it or not. so nothing to worry about</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If you never received a payment. Do not worry about it.  Why don&#039;t you ask him for proof of payment as you have no record of a payment from him.  This should take care of it!</Content>

            <Content>Paypal will hold that money until you go to their site and ask for it to be withdrawn and sent to your own bank account. I bet if you log in to your Paypal account you will see it sitting there. Yes it will be fraud if you don&#039;t perform the service for which you have been paid.</Content>
