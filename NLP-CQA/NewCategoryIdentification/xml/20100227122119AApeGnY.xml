    <ChosenAnswer>What browser are you using? I would try downloading Google Chrome.
Mine used to be very messed up at time and Chrome runs on so much less and doesn&#039;t hold as high of a cache. 

Everything wen&#039;t back to perfect for me! Worth a shot, good luck !</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Well, try going into Control panel from the start button. Then click on Internet Options.Then where it says Browsing History click on Delete, this will get rid of old unnecessary temporary files which could be blocking up your computer. It helped mine.</Content>

            <Content>Firefox is a much better browser (IE just lays down and dies on some trivial little errors on websites), but if it&#039;s the parental controls that are blocking you, no browser will get to those sites.  Since you get here with no problem, I&#039;m betting it&#039;s the parental controls.  (And without the password you can&#039;t change that.)</Content>
