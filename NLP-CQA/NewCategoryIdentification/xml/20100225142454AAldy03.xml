    <ChosenAnswer>maybe you should try using chrome, also make sure to check Lockerz site for any help with that, I know it works in Chrome, but I have never tried in Firefox. I also just hate using IE because it is really slow on my computer compared to any other browser that is on my computer.</ChosenAnswer>
