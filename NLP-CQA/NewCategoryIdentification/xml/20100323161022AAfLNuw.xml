    <ChosenAnswer>Limewire is crap.

Of course, you should not download music illegally, but in case you were writing a novel about a misleaded individual who might do so, here is what that individual would do:

1. Download a bittorrent downloader.  uTorrent is the best, it&#039;s free, very fast, very small, and contains absolutely no bloatware or advertisements.
2. Find torrents online.  One of the best websites to use for searching is www.thepiratebay.org
3. Be respectful to others, if you download 10MB, keep your uTorrent open until you&#039;ve uploaded 10MB as well.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>a legitimate website that&#039;ll probably charge you to download it.  viruses are the chance you take when you download music without paying...i guess nothing in life is truly free.</Content>
