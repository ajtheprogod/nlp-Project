            <Content>You could remove it, but I wouldnt recommend it.  Open the control panel.  click programs.  click set your default programs.  this is where you can change which program is your default.  to remove it completely against my recommendations, click control panel, click programs, click programs and features, and click turn windows features on or off.  It is one of the listed features</Content>

            <Content>The first time you installed and used firefox it should have given you that option to make it your default browser. Now you should still be able to do that either in firefox options or in the control panel.

I would however not uninstall Internet Explorer, as not all sites work properly in firefox and the same goes for Internet Explorer, This is why it&#039;s good to have at least two different browsers installed on your computer. I have three

Internet Explorer
Fire Fox
and very recently Google Chrome</Content>

            <Content>You cannot get rid of IE as long as you&#039;re using Windows. IE is an intrinsic part of the OS.
But you can systematically (as needed) avoid the use of IE by any application, wirh the exception of Windows Explorer.
I haven&#039;t used IE since 2001, at all, even if a newly installed program open an IE window, I &quot;educated&quot; the program into not doing it anymore.</Content>

            <Content>Uh, IE is impossible to get rid of, blame Microsoft. If you want Firefox as default then: 
Open Firefox&gt;Tools&gt;Options&gt;Advanced&gt;General&gt;Check Now.

The General Tab is a small tab inside of the Advanced tab.</Content>
