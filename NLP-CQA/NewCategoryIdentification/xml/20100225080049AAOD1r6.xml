  <Question id="20100225080049AAOD1r6" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Are the following blogging websites safe?</Subject>
    <Content>I have this friend, Her son absolutely loves blogging. He is only 13 so it has to be safe for kids. I thought maybe he would like one of the following sites. 

http://www.blogr.com/ 

http://www.blogster.com/

https://www.blogger.com/start

PS. he uses blogger already, But I just want to make sure it is safe. I would love some suggestions as well. But please don&#039;t suggest Myspace. He likes myspace blogging but he wants a change. I hope these sites are safe. Please Answer if you use any of these sites, or if you know whether or not their safe. Thanks! :)

    <ChosenAnswer>They are safe as long as you monitor what he uses on there. If he is blogging his own blogs then it is perfectly fine. However there are many blogs out there that contain adult content you may not want him to see. Check to see if they have parental controls.</ChosenAnswer>
