    <ChosenAnswer>you will not be charged if someone visits your site instead you have to pay annually to host u r site 
i.e there are annual charges for maintaining site on internet and if u use blogs they are free.

and if u want to earn money through your website design a good website and 

logon to www.google.com/adsense which provides u money by giving ads in u r website
