    <ChosenAnswer>On formspring, people are supposed to go to your page and ask you questions about yourself, while in y!a it&#039;s mostly informative, such as people asking for advice on things.

On formspring they ask stuff like &quot;how many guys have you dated?&quot; or &quot;what kind of music do you listen to?&quot;, just for fun.
