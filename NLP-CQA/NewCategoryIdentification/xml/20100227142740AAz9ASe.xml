    <Subject>Can I pay with a paysafecard for Skype?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m absolutely sure my ex-boyfriend used a paysafecard to top up his Skype account. I&#039;ve never done this myself and now when I try Skype offers to pay with a credit card, Maestro and something else but I can&#039;t find paysafecard on the list. Paysafecard homepage said it was possible to pay for Skype but there were no instructions there. Does anybody know if/how it works?

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi :)

Just go to the skype website (or choose to charge your account in skype directly) and then go through the process till you reach payment options. There you can either choose the four main options (which you don&#039;t want :) ) or you can choose &quot;other payment options&quot; below that (the pull down menu). Within that there&#039;s the option for paysafecard. Choose that and then just go to the next step where you can fill in your psc code.

Hope that helps!
