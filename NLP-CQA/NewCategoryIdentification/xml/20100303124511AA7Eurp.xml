            <Content>Either A, your internet connection sucks horribly, or B you are not letting the video load. Just let it sit for a few minutes to load, but if that doesn&#039;t work, it&#039;s your internet and you can&#039;t do anything about that. Computer has nothing to do with it.</Content>

            <Content>go to youtube and upload the show. Pause it while you wait for it to load.. then you will be able to watch the whole show once you&#039;ve uploaded it.. However, you might want to open three or four tabs cuz one show will be more than one video, so open a window, go to youtube.com, type the video you want. Then open a new tab (Ctrl+T) and start the next video going. Don&#039;t forget to pause them so they load fster.. then once the first video is complete, you can easily move to the next tab and continue without a problem</Content>
