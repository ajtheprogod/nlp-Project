    <ChosenAnswer>It means that when you log on to Twitter, you will see the latest posts (&quot;tweets&quot;) of those you follow, listed in chronological order from the most recent.

A lot like what happens when you log in to Facebook, except the posts are much shorter.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If you want tweets there are websites that enhance your tweets. Be careful what you wish for. You can end up with 2-300 People in days.. Well twitter is people who send SMS &quot;tweets&quot; to a Forum+ Cellphones. The ones who &quot;follow&quot; receive the &quot;tweets&quot;..
Luckily you can follow one person at a time and not get THEIR tweets too. But thats what makes the network so HUGE. It only took a few people to get into the thousands. As we know know its in the Millions WORLDWIDE..</Content>
