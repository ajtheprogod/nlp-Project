    <Subject>How to get a domain by doing surveys?</Subject>
    <Content>Well I have a website but its hosted by Ucoz. Like any other web hosting company, there name is in my domain name. So my site is bossman.ucoz.com. I want it to be bossman.com. I dont wanna spend money on a domain name and i dont want to use .tk or .co or anything like that. 

Are there any websites where you can do surveys to get a domain name. Plz dont redirect me to a the .tk or .co or .cc site. I want a site where i can do a whole bunch of surveys (yes i will take the time) to earn enough points to get a domain. NO SCAM SITES!!!

    <ChosenAnswer>Never heard of any, but my webhost gave me one for free and at only $4.84 how can you complain.. ?

Sometimes it&#039;s better to spend the time on your website content than spend hours filling in surveys for other people&#039;s websites.. Try to manage your priorities and concentrate on a website that will pay it&#039;s self every month.. and at $4 it&#039;s not going to take a lot of effort.

Hope it helps you.

            <Content>You can try FatCow. You check their domain registration panel. There you can register the name you want to book. FatCow offers very fast and highest uptime website hosting deals. I&#039;ve hosted a few websites on their servers, so far no problems at all. Their technical support at the server end is very prompt and they are quick in any resolution. Unlike many other big names who are expensive and at the same time their turn-around time for any issue is pretty longer. I&#039;m happy with FatCow. http://www.webhostingbreak.com/fat-cow-ecommerce/</Content>
