    <Subject>Ebay seller scammed me for 5000$ is there anything i can do?? Details inside!?</Subject>
    <Content>here is how it went down. the ebay seller had 100% feedback over 500 items sold. they were selling a camera that i bought for just over 5,000$. they then took the money, cashed it out to their bank account. never sent the item,  then (according to paypal) they removed their bank account and debit card from their paypal. closed down their paypal account. i have tried contacting them and nothing. they live all the way across the country. is there anything that can really be done? or am i just out of 5k here?

    <ChosenAnswer>If you bought it through ebay.com through paypal, then ebay stands behind items sold and should refund you even if they have to eat the 5000. Contact ebay and paypal about this and get yo money!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Contact eBay and tell them you want to launch criminal charges.  Is the seller in the same country as you at least?  If not then you are in deep doo-doo.</Content>
