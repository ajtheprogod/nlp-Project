  <Question id="20100315195417AAU3WZb" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What websites can I listen to music on for free?</Subject>
    <Content>What are some websites that I can listen to music for free? I do not want to have to download anything onto my computer for it to work, and I would like to not have to create any account either. Also, do not mention youtube.com, because the sound quality sucks.

I have iTunes, but I have no money to spend on songs right now, so don&#039;t bring iTunes up. I have tried grooveshark.com but currently it is not working when I try to go to it, and playlist.com takes forever to load after Myspace bought it out.

So, if anyone has some websites where I can listen to musci for free that is not Youtube.com, pleae answer.

Thank you.
EDIT: I failed to mention last.fm.com. Although it loads fine, when I want to listen to the songs, it takes me to a Youtube.com video, which I do not want. Thanks for the attempt though!

@ *Hottie101* I highly doubt that it is legal anywhere to download music for free.

    <ChosenAnswer>Hey Mate:

this is what you&#039;re looking for:

http://www.last.fm/

And well, on youtube, if you type in... &quot; metallica nimes  high quality &quot; or stuff like that, you can get pretty good quality music, after all.


Good luck :)</ChosenAnswer>
