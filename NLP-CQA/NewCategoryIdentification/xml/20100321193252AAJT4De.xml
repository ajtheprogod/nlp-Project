    <Subject>Is it illegal to watch movies online?</Subject>
    <Content>As far as I know, it is not illegal to watch movies online as long as you don&#039;t make a copy of it.
Is this correct?
I wanted to watch Alice in Wonderland on a website called www.vidreel.com but I&#039;m worried that it might get me into trouble.
My brother refuses to tell me so I ask you peoplez of the internetz!

            <Content>it is technically illegal because you&#039;re watching the movie without paying, and the producers won&#039;t get any money- so in a way it is stealing. though lots of people do it, so it doesn&#039;t cause much harm- i mean those producers are rich anyway, now they have to wait an extra month to get that jumbo jacuzzi in their backyard.</Content>
