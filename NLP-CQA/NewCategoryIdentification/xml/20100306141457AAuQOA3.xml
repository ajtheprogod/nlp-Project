    <ChosenAnswer>Don&#039;t use that stuff! See the risks of file-sharing technology at http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST05-007.html
Instead, look at http://searchformusic.eu.pn/
It searches more than 80 free, safe, legal music sites (for whole albums, add the word &quot;rapidshare&quot;). This way you can forget about viruses.

            <Content>Any free downloading program, or website is illegal, and has many, many viruses. If downloading from the web, the browser generally installs spyware, and adware onto your PC without you knowing.

Limewire has viruses which are easier to detect, but if you download a song from it that is not a song, your computer is caput, or completely useless until it gets cleaned out, or you end up having to reinstall Windows.

The only safe way to get free music, is Limewire, on a Mac. If you have both, you can download to your hearts content, because there are no Mac viruses to download using Limewire, the song just wont work, and you delete it.</Content>

            <Content>The safest way is to go to individual websites. Anytime you deal with websites with a lot of traffic you open yourself up to viruses, spyware, adware, etc. Here is a hip-hop/rap artist BrookDon&#039;s website with free downloads to get you started.
