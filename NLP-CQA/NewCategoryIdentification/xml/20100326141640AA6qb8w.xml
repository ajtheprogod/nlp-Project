    <Subject>Downloading videos help?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok, so I have a Youtube account and i really wanna upload some videos of interviews and stuffs. Some people on Youtube have videos of news reporters interviewing stars and stuff. A video kind of like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKFd_Dj5TIw . Alot of people have the same video as that on Youtube, but where do they get it? I&#039;m not talking about like they were there during the interview, i&#039;m talking about do they screen capture the video or something? If they DO screen capture it, can anyone tell me some really good screen captures that actually put AUDIO unlike CamStudio. and i don&#039;t wanna use Hypercam either. -___- But if they do something different, please tell me how. Like do they download the videos or something? If they DO download it, can anyone help me and tell me WHERE to download it? kthanks(:
btw, how do you download videos from OTHER websites besides youtube. thanks.
