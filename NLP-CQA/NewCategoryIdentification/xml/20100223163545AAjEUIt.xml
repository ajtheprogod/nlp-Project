  <Question id="20100223163545AAjEUIt" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Best Blog Site out there on the web?</Subject>
    <Content>Hey fellow answerers!  I am thinking about starting a &quot;blog&quot;.  I have created my own website (www.gems-for-the-teacher.com) before and actually still use it, but am interested in an actual on-going blog.

People are always asking me how i make things, updates on classroom crafts, holidays, etc. ( I am a preschooler teacher) as well as for recipes I&#039;ve made up, etc. and I think that a blog would be the best way to keep track of all of it!!  

So now the question is...what is the best &quot;blog&quot; site out there?  Have you/do you have your own blog?  And WHY do you think this site is the best??

I&#039;m looking for a site that is EASY to update (editing, photos, etc.), simple in design and having some cool features would be a bonus!

Thanks in advance!

-Amber

            <Content>I&#039;d personally go with http://www.wordpress.com as it has the best plugin and cool features so to speak. 

You can go to http://wordpressthemesbase.com to download better looking templates than the actual site offers.

It can be a bit of a learning curve with all the features but they offer a lot of free help and best of all it has seemless integration with social media and bookmarking.

Best of luck with your blog.</Content>
