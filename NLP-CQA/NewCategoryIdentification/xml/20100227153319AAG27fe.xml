            <Content>Sounds to me like you already have a virus. Internet Explorer was conceived by the terrorists in an attempt to crash Americas computers to better inflict terror upon our country.
The U.S. Government had set up an attempt to eliminate the &quot;Internet Explorer&quot; threat from the system and have succeeded on the most part, however, there have been scattered reports described in the same form as your problem that confirm that the virus is still out there affecting some computers, including yours.
If you set Internet Explorer as your default browser we will all surely die, you must go through a series of extremely complicated technical procedures that involve numerous codes and require extensive computer programming skills to remove the virus threat from your computer before it spreads to others, you usually have approximately 13 hours before it takes over and spreads to computers around the country. If you don&#039;t complete this highly tiresome and very complicated process in 13 hours then the terrorists WIN.
Good luck, we&#039;re all counting on you.</Content>
