    <ChosenAnswer>The most logical reason that I can think of is that their page is probably only created. It usually takes about a month for profiles to appear on the search page. If it&#039;s a celebrity you&#039;re searching for, try googling them, it is most likely that you will get a result from doing that. If it&#039;s not, the person you&#039;re searching for should come up anyway.
Try finding out this person&#039;s username and then put it into the search box, for example
twitter.com/anon

I hope that helps! :)</ChosenAnswer>
