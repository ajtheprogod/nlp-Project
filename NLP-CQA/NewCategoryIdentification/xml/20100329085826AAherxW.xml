    <ChosenAnswer>Toll free numbers have Real-time Automatic Number Identification (ANI) which identifies the caller&#039;s ten-digit phone number. This means that anytime someone calls the 800 number, ANI will unblock their caller ID even if they are calling from a blocked phone number. There is no extra charge for this service and it doesn&#039;t require any special equipment.

Say you have a friend that has a 800 number for like his business.  You keep getting anonymous phone calls (your caller id just says &quot;private&quot;).  If you can forward your number to that 800 number then it will unblock it and find out who is actually calling you.
