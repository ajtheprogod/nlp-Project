            <Content>I would say yes. The clothes are really provocative, and some of the emoticons used are more for adults.</Content>

            <Content>As a sixteen year old i feel that as a ten year old stuff like that should be off limits i mean it all flirting with other people and teaching them things like dressing in slutty clothes are okay.... it is just another web site that helps lower children&#039;s self esteem.  I use to play sims all the time last year and i felt that i could never be any good at anything if i did not look or act like the sims people did.... but it is all based on the opinion of the parents</Content>

            <Content>Even if the child knows more than most, its important to remember they are still a child. IMVU does have younger members but I do not recommend it. I am an avid IMVU and recommend it to anyone, that happens to be 14 and over. My child is 11, I would NEVER let them play on IMVU, there are too many predators and too many simply put..&quot;mean&quot; people. It can be harsh, even if the child &quot;knows more adult stuff&quot; Still, at 11 how much can the child know?</Content>
