    <ChosenAnswer>It could be that the seller has more than one of the same phones? Or that the first buyer told the seller they didn&#039;t want it after all. 

From TM. After the auction closes, the seller can offer the item to any bidder or trader who has added the auction to their Watchlist. If the item sold but the winning bidder did not complete the sale, the seller can then offer the item whether the auction met the reserve or not.</ChosenAnswer>
