  <Question id="20100322171426AArr1j3" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Firefox Memory Usage a little bit high?</Subject>
    <Content>this just started about 10 minutes ago. my firefox just got slower. alot slower. I go on chatroulette just for shits and giggles but it uses at least 100% of my computer usage via Taskbar manager and use as much RAM as it could, i have 2gb of ram and it got to about 1,500,000 K&#039;s! Then i just had to end process.

its just when i go on chatroulette it just takes up THIS MUCH MEMORY

is it firefox? or is it chatroulette itself, or is it my ISP?

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi, and sorry for my bad english (I&#039;m French).
No, it&#039;s not because of firefox... Chatroulette is running slow for everyone on earth today : they are upgrading the website. As you might have noticed, if you were connected today, it&#039;s glitchy too.

bye bye.</ChosenAnswer>
