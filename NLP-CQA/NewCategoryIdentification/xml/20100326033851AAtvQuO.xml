  <Question id="20100326033851AAtvQuO" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why does my browser (Firefox) start to have a delayed reaction after I have it open for an hour or so?</Subject>
    <Content>After like an hour or so I&#039;ll try to scroll or move the curser or type something and it will freeze for like a second before it reacts. I&#039;ll close and restart it and it will be fine, but then after an hour the same thing happens.

    <ChosenAnswer>Firefox is a memory hog and certain extensions are prone to memory leaks - keep task manager open and see the memory usage shoot up over time

Try to keep the number of tabs open to a minimum and get rid of any extensions you don&#039;t use anymore however &quot;cool&quot; they may be.

Or try Google chrome!</ChosenAnswer>
