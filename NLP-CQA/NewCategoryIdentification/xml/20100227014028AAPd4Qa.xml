  <Question id="20100227014028AAPd4Qa" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I get rid of a drop down from a company called Stub Hub?</Subject>
    <Content>It appears when I am composing an e=mail and blocks my ability to click send when I am finished composing.  There is no &quot;x&quot; or &quot;close&quot; visible for me to get rid of it.  My pop-up blocker is on...but this is a drop down that comes down from the tab area?  It is very annoying and disrupts my e-mail for several minutes while I close the page and start the e-mail agian.

    <ChosenAnswer>go to your control panel, and look for &quot;add/remove programs/software&quot;. Look on the list for the invasive spyware, and click to remove it.

It&#039;s likely you unknowingly had it downloaded when you followed a link or ad on the internet. Be careful of clicking on links, and if anything looks suspicious, immediately close the webpage. A lot of links are set up so software can be downloaded on your computer without your consent.

P.S. if you need more help like where your control panel is, email me from my profile.</ChosenAnswer>
