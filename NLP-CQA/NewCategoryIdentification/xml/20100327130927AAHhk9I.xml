    <Subject>How do I find a map of fibre optic and Virgin Media coverage in London?</Subject>
    <Content>It seems nigh on impossible to find a detailed map of fibre optic and Virgin Media coverage in London. I rent and actually want to physically move to an area which is covered by fibre optic. Is it possible to find a detailed coverage map online of actual London postcodes which have these services available?
