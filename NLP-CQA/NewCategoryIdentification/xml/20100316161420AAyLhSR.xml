    <Subject>Lockerz March Radness question?</Subject>
    <Content>Here are the Rules for March&#039;s Redemption:

1. The redemption will happen in March.
2. This redemption will happen in only one wave.
3. The redemption will be reserved for the winners of March Radness.
4. We will raise points levels by 4x.
5. It will be a surprise date and time.
6. Members are only allowed to redeem one (1) item.
7. There will be no exchanges, no returns, no cancellations and no PTZ refunds on redeemed prizes.
8. These Rules are in addition to Lockerz&#039; Terms of Use and PTZ Rules.


On #4, do they mean they&#039;re going to raise the PTZ the prizes are worth on the redemption? For example, if an iTouch was worth 800 PTZ, will it be worth 3200 PTZ now?

    <ChosenAnswer>Yeah all the costs for prizes are going up 4x

It&#039;s because the Play section was recently opened, and so you can get loads more points now (except it never works for me, so i&#039;m stuck for a while D: )</ChosenAnswer>
