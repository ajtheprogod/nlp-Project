    <ChosenAnswer>In a word, yes.

Since lots of people are moving away from the idea of contract mobile broadband for 2 years, there&#039;s been a surge of prepaid mobile broadband providers such as Virgin Mobile moving in to fill the gap.

Most of them simply lease the service of a larger provider (Virgin leases Sprint&#039;s network as you heard) and then repackage/resell it as their own. The upside to this is the service is solid and not a garbage like connection.

Since their are 2 types of prepaid providers (occasional use and regular use), it also depends on how often you plan to use the internet.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If you can prepay for minutes to talk on a phone why not prepay for internet. on the other hand, software typically checks for updates from it&#039;s website automatically  which would use your prepaid minutes every time you&#039;d start an application.
It probably exist, but it&#039;s up there with paying for radio like Sirius.</Content>
