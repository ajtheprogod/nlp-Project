            <Content>Proxies are normally shut down very soon after they are posted, the best way around this that I found is a program called vidalia. http://www.torproject.org/vidalia/  This program will connect you to a huge list of people that willingly open their computers to be used as proxies. Its 100% legal, and with a simple click of a button, you can connect to a new proxy. Edit* forgot to mention it&#039;s free..</Content>

            <Content>I tried hundreds of free proxies/vpn&#039;s over many months. All I got out of it was a lot of frustration as they got blocked in short order. Well I got one more thing and that was a virus from one of them that wrecked my HD. Even when they worked for a while they were slow and didn&#039;t support all the web site features. My friend in Riyadh told me about the Personal VPN http://www.surfbouncer.com. He&#039;s kind of an expert on unblocking sites because he lives in a place where pretty much everything fun is blocked.

Anyway, I tried it a few months ago and it&#039;s been working all the time. I haven&#039;t been blocked since and the sites are 100% functional. With the Personal VPN everything works like it&#039;s supposed to. Once connected you don&#039;t even know it&#039;s there. It&#039;s not free but it works perfectly.</Content>
