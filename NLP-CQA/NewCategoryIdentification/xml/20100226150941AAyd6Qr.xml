            <Content>woah. that&#039;s really creepy.
i actually think its some kid getting random screennames off the internet and IMing them.
he IMed me too thet other day &quot;hey. you&#039;re hot... haha you have no idea who this is&quot;
and it freaked me out at first cause i actually thought he had stalked me or seen me somehow. but then i was like no he&#039;s just being an idiot.
i would block him. he&#039;s really weird.</Content>
