  <Question id="20100304030203AAjMSDY" type="Answered">
    <Subject>&#039;Watch This Item&#039; link on eBay is not working?</Subject>
    <Content>I click on it and it does nothing. Absolutely nothing. It&#039;s only been like this for a few hours and I&#039;ve tried signing out and signing back it but that didn&#039;t change it. WTF?
It&#039;s been a few days now and still nothing. I can&#039;t leave feedback either. This has never happened before.

    <ChosenAnswer>Yeah its a ebay glitch,  sometimes it works, other times well you know the answer.

Edit - Have you tried deleting cookies, temp int files, clearing the cache all that sort of stuff.? I have seen problems identical to yours on ebays community forums.  Maybe you could try ebays live chat if the above doesnt help.</ChosenAnswer>
