    <ChosenAnswer>Certain domain names are already investments.  People buy domain names (like Madonna.com, wallstreetjournal.com etc) in the hope that the companies or people who have that name will buy it off them so they can make a profit.

Some even end up in court. http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/10/16/madonna.cybersquatter.reut/

To answer your question, we won&#039;t have domain names in the future.  Everything will be linked and will be done more like a search engine to get to view the information you want.</ChosenAnswer>
