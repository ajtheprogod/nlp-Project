  <Question id="20100319114528AAcwKfz" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What should I name a blog?</Subject>
    <Content>I want to document all the odd, crazy, funny, unique situations and dealings I&#039;ve had with customers and people in general.  I&#039;ll keep it all confidential, but just want to share stories with my family and friends.  

For example, I had a customer today ask if we could refund her estate if she died before we were able to provide her with what she had just paid for.  

And the other day, I had an older gentleman walk in at work and say &quot;Well Hello, there, Woody!&quot;.  

I want the blog name to be fun and humorous, but catchy.
