    <ChosenAnswer>I know it&#039;s kinda sick, but I was curious about it too. I mean, someone in the audience must have had their camera going during the accident, and must have posted it on youtube. But I checked youtube, and there&#039;s nothing there. (I&#039;m guessing that anyone who might have posted it, had it taken down by authorities.) There&#039;s at least one hoax though. The video starts out with WARNING: GRAPHIC FOOTAGE. Then it&#039;s a still photo of a trainer and a whale, with talking bubbles singing through an 80&#039;s song. Haha.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The incident happened AFTER the main show had finished and there where only a few people present for the after show feeding.

I would wager that that seaworld asked anybody who did have footage to be sensitive and not distribute the footage.

I wouldn&#039;t want a video of my loved one dying on the internet........would you?</Content>
