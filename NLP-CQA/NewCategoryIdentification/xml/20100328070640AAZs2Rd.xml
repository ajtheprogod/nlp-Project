  <Question id="20100328070640AAZs2Rd" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is anyone else having problems with Megavideo?</Subject>
    <Content>In the past 3 days every time I use Megavideo I get to only watch 10 mins of it &amp; then it will stop &amp; say I have watched 72 mins &amp; have to wait 53 mins to watch any more. Before I was actually getting to see 72 mins of my movie before it would stop, but now I am just barely getting to begin it.
It didn&#039;t do that before, just started doing that to me in the past few days. It is only site way I can watch season 5 Ghost Whisperer episodes (I go to surf the channel &amp; can only find links for Megavideo for them).
