            <Content>It&#039;s how companies do business.  Even in a store, when you buy something from an advisor (as opposed to a plain cashier) he/she will often invite you to look at something else.
Not sure why you&#039;re picking on BT, it&#039;s a very common business practice</Content>

            <Content>Id watch out too, Lets just say they &quot;Bend&quot; the truth when trying to sell you things. All you have to do with BT is point out the obvious.... That their product is usually the more expensive. They tried selling me capped broadband for 17.99 a month.... when i have unlimited at the same speed for 14.99 a month. Sure enough they didnt know what to say then.</Content>
