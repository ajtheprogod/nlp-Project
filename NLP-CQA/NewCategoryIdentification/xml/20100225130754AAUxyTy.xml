    <Subject>Internet Explorer script error question?</Subject>
    <Content>I keep getting this script errors when I do a search on yahoo. Right now I&#039;m being very cautious because we had a virus and we just got our computer fixed. This is the message I get on yahoo when I do a search:

Internet Explorer Script Error
An Error has occured in the script on this page
Line: 1
Char: 3531
Error: Object doesn&#039;t support this property or method
Code: 0
URL: http://a.l.yimg.com/a/lib/s5/csp_201002171459.js

Do you want to continue running scripts on this page?
Yes or No

What do these script errors mean and how do I fix it?

            <Content>Well Valerie, Internet Explorer is a very unstable, very untrustworthy browser in its own right.
I&#039;m not only saying this from a haters point of view, but also from the words of the wise, professional reviewers and recently, even government officials (http://bit.ly/8MF3CL).

So, my suggestion would be, you switch to a more reliable browser, in which there is tighter security, greater performance and less flaws. Personally, I&#039;d go for Apple&#039;s Safari 4, but then there are also a few other options available.
