  <Question id="20100322052323AA70SZa" type="Answered">
    <Subject>how can I meet someone twice on chatroulette or got my conversations back ?</Subject>
    <Content>On a friday night I had a wonderful conversation me Sultan with Chloe ( or Chole ) on Chatroulette . It was the first one I had and the last because we agreed not to back to that bad chat again . It was full of naked and sick old men . Unfortunately I went out without recalling saving&quot; Chole&quot; skype . Now I have nothing to contact her again . May be this is stupid but is there anyway to get your conversation back ?.. Many thanks
