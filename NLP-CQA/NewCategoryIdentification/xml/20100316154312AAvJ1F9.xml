  <Question id="20100316154312AAvJ1F9" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can you get in your GaiaOnline account?</Subject>
    <Content>It seems that some people can get into their gaia accounts, but some are completely missing and in peoples friends blocks are just empty where some used to be. My main account I cannot access, while other accounts I can (mules with nothing on them).

This is not my background but it is my profile I am missing, on my boyfriends friendlist I am also missing. http://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd359/Linny_Cat/Picture5.png

I hope there wasn&#039;t a major hacking D:&lt; Random people are like this too.
