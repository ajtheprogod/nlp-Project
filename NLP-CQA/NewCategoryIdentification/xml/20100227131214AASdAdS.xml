    <ChosenAnswer>Don&#039;t do it.  It works as an affiliate marketing scheme, that is you only get gifts if you get other people to sign-up and take up &quot;offers&quot;, and do some yourself.  These are very risky because they are &quot;free trials&quot; which people end up having to pay for if they do not cancel on the right date, and some are just reductions they have to pay for, or things like signing up for a bank account or car insurance, and lots of gambling sites are included.
