  <Question id="20100321202412AAzyE3w" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Multiple Tumblr blogs?</Subject>
    <Content>So, I have one main tumblr blog.  That was how it was for a while.  But today, I wanted to start another blog.  So, on my dashboard, I went over to the sidebar on the left, click the name of my original blog, and then click &#039;create new blog&#039;.  I created it, even posted in it!  When I went back to my dashboard, it disappeared!  I don&#039;t know where it went!  It just listed my original blog!  Someone please help me.

    <ChosenAnswer>i have two blogs too.
that was a problem for me
BUT if you click on your tumblr username
underneth it, it will have a link to your second blog and when you click it it should
lead you to your second blog
but somehow your first blog will always be the default one</ChosenAnswer>
