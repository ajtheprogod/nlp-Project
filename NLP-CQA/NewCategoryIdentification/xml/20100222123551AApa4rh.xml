    <ChosenAnswer>Basic Answer: Yes.

Realistic Answer: If he works somewhere with more than 20 people, chances are his boss doesn&#039;t care enough to check and/or read your conversation. He&#039;s probably fine until he starts looking at porn during work or his productivity suffers noticeably.</ChosenAnswer>

        <Answer>
            <Content>Yes they can. And it&#039;s legal too. Because he&#039;s at work and (I assume) using their computer, they&#039;re allowed to install all the tracking software they want.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>almost undoubtedly yes, they dont even really have to know what they&#039;re doing with computers, there are millions of programmes to do that. also, the bigger the company, the higher the chance that they are tracking everything everyone does on their network</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>well there are programs out there that look at other computers in a network. 

what this means is since your boyfriend is using the work&#039;s internet, this means there is the &quot;big guy&quot; that is connected to all these computers, giving them the internet. Now with the program, IF he has it, he can see what your boyfriend and every employer is looking at. Now this is the only guy that can do this, everyone else is a &quot;pawn&quot;. 

If you want my opinion i dont think they care as long as he is doing his job as he is talking.

i hope this helps</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>Yes they can.

AIM itself and incredible insecure and basically a huge gaping hole in your computer inviting every cyber criminal to have a field day.
AOL doesn&#039;t give a shit about it&#039;s users so they never fix anything wrong with their software.

You install AIM and every hacker on the planet can access everything on your PC.
They can trivially crack you AIM password as well.

As an IT admin I don&#039;t care that you are cybering with your wife/husband instead of working - that is your boss&#039;s problem.
I care that you just destroyed the entire network&#039;s security and that might mean more work for me to clean up the mess.</Content>

            <Content>My brother once installed a program designed so that teachers could monitor everything that was happening on students computers. It allowed him to view everything I was doing, and even take over remotely. If he can do that at home, they can do it even better at work with corporate funding</Content>
