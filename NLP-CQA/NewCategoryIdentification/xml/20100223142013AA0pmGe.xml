    <ChosenAnswer>NEVER Refund 1st. Wait till u get it back, and when you do Inspect all the returned goods in detail (even smell it if u have to) to make sure you are not being scammed. Some people will swap your goods for faulty goods acquired else where. When and if you are 100% satified that the goods was yours then consider the refund.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If its faulty, you should fully refund here (including postage) and actually pay for postage to send items back.  Thats in an ideal world. Howver, it the disc drive IS broken, is it worth that? Maybe just refund her the actual price she paid and tell her to not bother sending it.</Content>
