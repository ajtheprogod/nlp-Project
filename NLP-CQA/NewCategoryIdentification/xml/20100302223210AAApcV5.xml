  <Question id="20100302223210AAApcV5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there a service or website that allows me to gather any sort of public record/information i need in one?</Subject>
    <Content>place? like if i needed to find out who stayed in a certain hotel on a given night or who owned a trailer in a trailer park in a certain town between two given years, just random stuff like that. I&#039;d pay anything for this service or website. Basically I&#039;m looking to track down certain people from my past to inform them of some things but I forgot their names, and some of that random information are just the keys I need to find certain people.

    <ChosenAnswer>Most of this data, even if someone keeps them, is considered to be private information, and it would be somewhat difficult to get it into your own hands. You&#039;d have to either contact the owner of the hotel/trailer park or whoever might have this information and either hope they&#039;re nice people and hand it over to you (free or at a charge) or you&#039;d need a court order and/or warrant, which seems like overkill to me.

There are websites to look up personal information, for example, like PeopleLookup, but I doubt you&#039;d get that detailed information from anyone.
