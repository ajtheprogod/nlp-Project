  <Question id="20100319183608AALnL2F" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Do I need a full install of Firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>I can&#039;t &#039;see&#039; some important content of pages - many colors and items just aren&#039;t there; perhaps I did something in preferences to screw it up. 
 If I do a full install will it save my bookmarks? Anything else I should know?
Thank you!
Should I save anything? Delete all pertaining Firefox files before reinstalling?
