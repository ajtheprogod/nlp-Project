    <Subject>Internet connection keeps cutting out?</Subject>
    <Content>For the last 3 or 4 weeks my internet connection has been cutting out a lot and the signal says it is poor pretty much 24/7. My computer is new, I got it just after christmas and the connection has been strong and never used to cut out until about 4 weeks ago. It&#039;s starting to get really annoying! Whenever it goes off, I trouble shoot it and it says to turn off or unplug the router and leave for 10 seconds etc, so I do this and when I put it back on it the internet still disconnects the same as before. Sometimes it says something about a DNS problem or something? 

I&#039;m not very good with computers, so I have no idea what is causing the problem or how to fix it. Does anyone have any ideas? I am wondering whether to contact my provider, sky, but I&#039;d rather be able to fix it myself. I am also using Windows 7.
