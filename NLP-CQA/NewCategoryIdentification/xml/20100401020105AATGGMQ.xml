  <Question id="20100401020105AATGGMQ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What can I do about this imageshack problem?</Subject>
    <Content>I uploaded a few images on imageshack when I had no account so I could not delete them. I want to delete them now and you can do that when you have an account. Is there any way I can claim the images I uploaded when I had no account, as mine?

Thanks
