    <ChosenAnswer>I prefer google chrome because it is simple. Its fast and basically is just good. Google Chrome even has extensions if you really want them. Safari and Google Chrome both use the same engine. I think google chrome is faster though because in a lot of speed tests on youtube chrome wins.</ChosenAnswer>
