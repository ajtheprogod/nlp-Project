  <Question id="20100324232419AAWBRDv" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Do I need to pay the outstanding amount for domain registration?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi I have registered a domain name in one.com for $15. This company belongs to Europe. I have not used that domain afterwards. Next year they sent a post to my address and sent a mail that your outstanding amount is $43.In terms &amp; conditions they specified like you have to send the cancellation request. Will it cause any major legal issues if I don&#039;t care about this. Need help please.
