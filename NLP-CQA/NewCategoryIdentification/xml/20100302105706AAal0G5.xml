    <Subject>Is it possible for a website to show up in the internet history without logging on to it?</Subject>
    <Content>So I have this strange thing going on on my computer. Recently in the history its been saying that I&#039;ve logged onto Facebook. I know my sister has used this computer a long time ago to log on to her account but not in a long time. I&#039;ve noticed that facebook keeps showing up in the history. Can anyone explain this?
