    <ChosenAnswer>Ebay is generally good for buying online. Generally sellers are more wary of buyers, especially if you have less than 10 points feedback. If you were to buy from them, it&#039;s best to check their feedback first to see how others have found their buying experience with that particular buyer. Usually those who have feedback more than 95-100% are the ones to trust.

If you are unfortunate enough to have a bad experience, paypal and ebay are usually really good support wise and will try their best to get you your money back, especially paypal. Good luck!</ChosenAnswer>
