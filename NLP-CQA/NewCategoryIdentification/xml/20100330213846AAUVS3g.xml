    <ChosenAnswer>you cant delete your account online. What they did is you downloaded some stuff to your computer, right? when you were installing it? You have to look in where you saved it and delete the files that have to do with Zwinky. I had the same thing happen almost... a year ago(?). getting old cant remember times!
**Just make sure to delete ONLY the zwinky program. if you delete other files on your computer it will be very, very, bad!**</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Simple.
    If you have a toolbar of it, delete it.A new window shall pop out and it would say that why are you uninstalling zwinky.Then tick on the box that states- i don&#039;t want a zwinky account.Follow the steps and your account will be deleted.
    And if you don&#039;t have a toolbar yet,download it via your id and then follow the above steps.</Content>
