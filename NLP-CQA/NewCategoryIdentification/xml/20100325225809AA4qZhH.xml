  <Question id="20100325225809AA4qZhH" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Please help me register on this website.?</Subject>
    <Content>Can someone help me to register to the website: http://www.chaoticcardcodes.com/index.phâ€¦ I went there and there is only one link to register which is under the &quot;Forum&quot; tab, but when I clicked on it it sent me to a page that said, &quot;You are not authorized to view this page! You need to log in.&quot; But how can I log in if it will not even let me register? If you can, please help me. Thank you!
it&#039;s for an online card game, and thanks for trying, I was wondering if it was just my internet, but fortunately it&#039;s not, it&#039;s just the website, wow lots of commas
