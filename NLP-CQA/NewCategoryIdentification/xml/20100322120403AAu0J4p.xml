    <Subject>eBay refund advice, should i accept return?</Subject>
    <Content>So here is my dilemma, I sold a canon hi8 camcorder on ebay and it was in great working condition. in my ad i clearly stated that all sales are final and the item is sold as is.  The girl who purchased it says that when she plays back the tape on the camcorder it makes distortion noises. To be honest she didn&#039;t even really ask to work it out, she kinda demanded right away and threatened to get pay pal involved. Should I accept the return or stick to my ad?

    <ChosenAnswer>Maybe she doesnt know how it works properly, dont camcorders have certain functions that alleviate distortion noises? Quite possible she has just had a change of heart...some buyers are near impossible to please.
She would have to prove to paypal that it is not as described which I would think would be hard to do.  Its hard to say whether paypal would side with her,  SNAD disputes can be rather tricky, 
I guess it really comes down to what you think is the best way to handle it.  If you are prepared for paypal to make a decision let her open a dispute.</ChosenAnswer>
