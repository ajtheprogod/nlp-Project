    <ChosenAnswer>I still can&#039;t understand, why are you calling your 3 posts boring. As blogging is nothing but a hobby; and no one feels bored when indulged in that hobby. It&#039;s an altogether different thing, that some people start making money from their blogs in due course and in some cases make it their profession. But doesn&#039;t it similar to someone taking his/her hobby as a profession? That said, I suggest you to search for things you&#039;re passionate about. And one more thing, you have chosen a good blogging platform, Blogger.com.

You can write or say about anything which you&#039;re passionate about in your blog. In addition, unlike real world newspapers and magazines, which mostly follow strict grammar rules; blogging has no rules prescribed. Any writing style which clicks with the readers is good. 

Hence , don&#039;t feel that you&#039;ll need some special guidance to blog well. Just write what your heart says you to write.

Some dos and donts:

1) If a thought comes to your mind, write it.

2) While writing a post (an article in a blog is called a post) never tell yourself that the final product will be perfect. Instead, tell yourself, &quot; I&#039;m writing for myself ; so I don&#039;t care even if the finished post appears like a trash&quot;.

3) Write without inhibitions (remember: this doesn&#039;t mean being impolite).

4) Write as much as possible

5) An article written for a blog; should always be posted. Even if the finished article doesn&#039;t look post worthy; go ahead and post it. initial quality non-conformances go with time. So make a motto: Write and go ahead and post.

5) Don&#039;t expect anything to be obvious. You&#039;ll yourself find that, things which seem quite obvious, make for best posts.

If you want to concentrate on writing; outsource the technical part to someone else.

            <Content>A good topic would be.. you. If you like something, write a complete blog about it. Or if you have a website, try advertising it.

If you want some tips, make sure to keep it real and serious, don&#039;t go off topic, don&#039;t make it oh so boringly long, and of course, use proper grammar.</Content>
