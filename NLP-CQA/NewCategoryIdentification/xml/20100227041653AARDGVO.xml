            <Content>Internet speed is a funny thing. When you pay for a 10MBps connection, the ISP sets aside that bandwidth for your use. However, that&#039;s the maximum TOTAL bandwidth for your connection. If the download server you are connecting to can&#039;t upload at 10MBps, then you can&#039;t download from them at 10MBps.

It&#039;s like buying a two-lane highway and only having a bicycle on the road; you CAN run two semis side by side, but if all you have is a bike...

Try speedtest.net to get a semi-accurate indication of your actual connection speed.</Content>

            <Content>For running slow there are many causes:
Microsoft Registry Problems
RAM
De-Fragmenting
Etc. 

Clean windows registry can speed up the computer.
Registry Cleaner can fix your pc errors.
Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software&#039;s, install new devices, 
download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system.
This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. 
Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.
Clean registry make pc faster.
