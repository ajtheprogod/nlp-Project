            <Content>Easiest way to explain...  Let&#039;s say you&#039;re typing something in a chatroom and you press enter, then it takes 10 seconds longer that it should.  That&#039;s 10 seconds lag.  &quot;I&#039;m lagging&quot; / &quot;I&#039;ve got some killer lag&quot; / &quot;I am laggerrific!&quot; means they are experiencing this.</Content>

            <Content>it means the internet or web-page/game is delaying. 
like when you click or move the mouse and it doesn&#039;t move for a few seconds.

it just takes time for your computer to communicate with the servers and return the information (keystroke or mouse movement) to you.</Content>

            <Content>It&#039;s in the dictionary:  &quot;fall or stay behind&quot;  ...if you went you running with a friend and she was slow, you could say she was lagging.

Used in terms of computer lingo, it means their computer or internet is slow.  So maybe they&#039;re getting your messages late or the screen is freezing.</Content>
