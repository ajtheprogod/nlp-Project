            <Content>Yes they can even if signed in or not.
If they know your username and the products you sell they can search for your products and view the rest of what you are selling from the &quot;view sellers shop&quot; or &quot;see other items&quot; links from an item listing.

No one has to sign in to see anyones items the block bids and buyers merely stops that user from placing a bid, nothing else.

There is also outside ebay programmes that will allow an individual to search a sellers buying selling habits and can even work out what money that seller is making or losing.
www.goofbay.com is one tool.</Content>

            <Content>Yes they can and they can send you messages. I blocked someone the other week, he was messing around saying he bought the wrong item and could I give him a good price on the item he meant to buy. Then he didn&#039;t pay so I blocked him from bidding on my remaining auctions.  He messaged me to say why was he blocked!</Content>
