  <Question id="20100329130929AAyu67V" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is www.festivalticketstore.com trustable?</Subject>
    <Content>My sister just purchased a ticket from this website to go to the Reading Festival (lots of bands will be there) she&#039;s been so excited for ages about it and the main site was so busy (as lots and lots of people across the country want to buy the tickets) we tried different websites, and came across this one. It looked very legitimate and legal and we checked the rules and it was all okay, so we called the hotline and ordered them. My sister was fine about it all when she looked on the Reading Festival forum, where many users recommended people NOT to buy from http://festivalticketstore.com/. My sister immediatley started worrying, she was so worried that it was all a scam and my dad would lose his money! It was so worrying, as I googled information and there were a few sites with lists of illegal and scam websites and http://festivalticketstore.com/ was on some of the lists. My sister then rang the customer services and the ticket companies, which then advised her that they had no idea, but since they had given her a reference number there shouldnt be much to worry about. She was still worried though.

My dad then arrived home and my sister asked him to phone them up and double check, he then looked at the website and said it looked fine. My mum also said the same thing. my sister was still worried ut and asked him to cancel the ticket order, as friends told her eventually it wasn&#039;t trustable. My dad was unable to cancel the tickets, however at this moment my parents are still trying, however you cant cancel the tickets. My sister says that its probably not fake, and she feels much better for some reason, however she is still worried a little bit.

What I am asking for is ONLY people who are going to give me detailed and clear answers, not unclear answers as this is an important issue.

Has anyone out there ever ordered a ticket from http://festivalticketstore.com and if so did it arrive? Was it a true, legal and UNSCAMMED website? Were the tickets acceptable to go in to the concert or festival?

PLEASE ANSWER ALL THOSE QUESTIONS IF POSSIBLE.

If you have ever been a customer for http://festivalticketstore.com it would be so kind if you could tell me your experiences with it.

THANK YOU SO SO MUCH!!!

Would be appreciated if you answered quickly.

All answers gain points! :)
Oh and to user called Paul:

My sister checked and said that it is alright if the lock icon was on it.

    <ChosenAnswer>If you can get a refund I&#039;m sorry to say please try to, if you&#039;ve paid via credit card it should be refundable hopefully. Please only use the links from the official page, last year I used Jumbo Records who were excellent in speed on the website and delivery. Good luck I sincerely hope she goes and has a good time, I&#039;m envious of the fun she&#039;ll have, as im not going this year. But DEFINITELY try and refund, don&#039;t settle, more tickets get disrtributed throughout the year try again every week or so. Good Luck.
