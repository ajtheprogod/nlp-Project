  <Question id="20100321061825AAoPyBY" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I need some advice...?</Subject>
    <Content>I asked this question before but for some reason it got deleted. So I recently created a blog and I was just wondering what other people thought of it. I&#039;m new to this whole blogging world so I was just wondering if there was anything I can do to make my blog better. Be honest, I really want to know what you think. Also, any good suggestions to get some more followers would be great.

    <ChosenAnswer>My question was deleted and Yahoo Answer&#039;s team never explained to me why they did it and I could&#039;t find a reason in their contract. I think they are not listening to the people who use this site. This is indicative of poor management.</ChosenAnswer>
