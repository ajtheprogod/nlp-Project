  <Question id="20100304150200AAlNll5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I accidentally clicked something...?</Subject>
    <Content>I was using stumble-upon (I&#039;m 13), when I accidently clicked on something and ended up on some sort of porn site. Then it said I was in trouble and they knew my name and information and they were going to report be to the police and call my house! I&#039;m really scared. I don&#039;t even know what I did. Is it just a hoax or can they really prosecute me?

    <ChosenAnswer>It is probably just a hoax, and you shouldn&#039;t be worried. It is very hard to find out name and other information of a first-time visitor of a website.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>well first of all, they knew exactly all you personal info? if so, ya. you should be.
