    <ChosenAnswer>Sites containing the term warez are actively sought out and terminated by companies like Microsoft and RIAA. Because they are illegal, they are temporary by their very nature. If the site is not back up within a month of going down, you&#039;ll simply need to move on to the next site.

Be very careful about advertising the fact that you support piracy, end users began being charged and convicted of copyright infringement a few years ago, and it seems that most people on the web are very much against warez.</ChosenAnswer>
