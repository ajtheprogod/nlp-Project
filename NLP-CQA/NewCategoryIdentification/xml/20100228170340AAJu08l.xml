    <ChosenAnswer>* LEVEL UP. For every level you get to you get one Farmville Cash buck.

    * EARN RIBBONS. Every time you earn a ribbon, you automatically receive 1 free Cash buck.

    * BUY THEM. Although the game is free to play, the company would like people to buy Farm Dollars with real money to buy specialized items, so that they can use the real money to help offset the expenses of running the game servers. Sp you can buy Farm Cash with real American money. You must pay Zynga by credit card online, by clicking the &quot;+ Add coins and cash&quot; link at the top-left of the page.

    * COMPLETE THE FREE OFFERS. The best ones are the ones saying &quot;Reach final steps.&quot; Just go through it all, putting in false information so you don&#039;t get spammed. Once you reach the final steps page, take a screenshot and close the browser. You should get your Farmville cash within a minute. If you don&#039;t receive it, go back onto the missing farm cash area and click on the customer support. Type in your question of &quot;Where is my farm cash etc.?&quot; and post a link to your screenshot taken earlier. Wait approximately 1-3 hours and you will have your Farmville cash, along with an email of apology from the support for your troubles. This is the best and real only way of getting a good amount; I have received about 300 farm cash from doing this offer as there is no limit - so just do them all. Makes it easy to get the Manor. (Warning - It does ruin the email address you use, but it isn&#039;t impossible to work.)
