  <Question id="20100307105540AAQBEIR" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Ebay rating question. Can someone please explain?</Subject>
    <Content>Hey I have an ebay account and have purchased 7 items with it and have received 7 positive feedback. I purchased from 3 different sellers. However the number next to my account name only says 4. Why is this? Could someone please explain how this number is calculated and what it means? I thought that that was the number of total items purchased or sold. 

My ebay user name is classy_yet_crazy if you want to look it up to see what I mean.

Thanks for your help everyone :)
