    <ChosenAnswer>First of all, did you try re-installing it? That can sometimes work. If you did, then there could be a virus possibility, in which case you will have to update your antivirus program and then scan for viruses. It could also be your registry. Download a program called &quot;ccleaner&quot; from www.download.com and run a registry scan with it. Or it might be your hardware. Does it only happen with firefoc, or with other programs as well. I know that any of my programs that access the H: Drive crash immediately because there is a problem with that drive. You might want to get someone to look at the parts of your computer/laptop if it is over a year old.

            <Content>I&#039;m sorry. If it doesn&#039;t work out, may I suggest Google Chrome, Opera, or Safari? They are very fast, especially compared to Firefox.</Content>

            <Content>That is indeed odd behavior for Firefox.  I know it&#039;s a pain but have you tried uninstalling, reboot, and reinstalling firefox.  Perhaps an incompatible plugin got added that is causing this. Probably couldn&#039;t hurt to do a quick scan to rule out trojans/virus&#039;s as well.</Content>
