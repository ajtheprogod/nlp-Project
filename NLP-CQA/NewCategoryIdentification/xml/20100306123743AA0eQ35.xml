  <Question id="20100306123743AA0eQ35" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Firefox wont open for me?</Subject>
    <Content>Whenever I try to open Firefox it says &quot;Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system.&quot;
Firefox isn&#039;t open, and I don&#039;t see why that matters anyway as you can have multiple windows open...
I have tried doing what it says in the message - logging off and on, restarting my computer etc.
I have tried going to Processes on Task Manager and trying to end any firefox related processes, but there wasn&#039;t anything there anyway.
What can I do? I&#039;m using SeaMonkey at the moment and it&#039;s awful (mainly because who likes change??)
(I&#039;m reposting this Q because last time I asked it everybody said &quot;restart your computer&quot; because I forgot to say I had already done it.   -   I&#039;m looking for somebody who knows atleast a little bit about computers/web browsers to answer this, not teenage girls who want to know how to wear their hair and use :3 faces.)
Thanks guys, some real answers.
I have tried going to Processes in Task manager, but there was nothing with Mozilla or Firefox in the name

            <Content>Firefox has had some issues lately. What I had to do was use Google Chrome (or you could use IE) and download the latest version of Firefox. I haven&#039;t had any issues since. Hope this helps.</Content>
