Could not find any ending with Bee. You could try googling &quot;tv commercial auction&quot; and put the name of the tv channel you saw it on in there.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>bumblebee auction? It&#039;s a UK Police auction site. It&#039;s &quot;cheap stuff&quot; because it&#039;s police confiscated and could be damaged with no warranty or repairs.

It&#039;s sort of like Propertyroom.com located in the U.S


Course I could be wrong</Content>
