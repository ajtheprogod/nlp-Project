        <Answer>
            <Content>You could try network marketing. It allows you to work around your schedule, kids, school, etc.

Find something that peaks your interest. Perhaps make-up, clothing, accessories, shoes, health products, cleaning products, baskets, etc.

Just find something that you can get excited about and then go for it.</Content>

            <Content>Get into internet marketing, it doesn&#039;t have to cost you a cent.
Get a site, get traffic to it (a separate blog might help here) and all sales you generate are yours.
This  is one example: http://job--listings.info/MyFreeAffiliateSite</Content>
