    <ChosenAnswer>Too many cookies are piling up within your computer causing an issue with your bandwidth. Simple way to fix this buffering issue.. Open web browser ---&gt; Tools ---&gt; internet options ---&gt; general tab ---&gt; browsing history ---&gt; delete ---&gt; delete all ---&gt; check box to delete cookie add-ons also ---&gt; yes ---&gt; close internet broswer/window ---&gt; open browser and go back to youtube. Now when you play that same video, it will play fine.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It CAN be a problem with your internet connection. Test your speeds at speedtest.net
If they are still fast, then yes, sometimes it is youtube and the server the video is located on is running a little slow.</Content>
