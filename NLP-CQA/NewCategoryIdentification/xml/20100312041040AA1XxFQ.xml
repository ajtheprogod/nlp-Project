    <ChosenAnswer>There are many good work from home jobs and there are many good home based businesses. A job is one where someone will pay you to do their work at home. A home based business is one where you&#039;ll earn commissions for running a business from home. If you&#039;re just looking to be paid for your services, do your research...you have to know the type of job you want to do, then look for companies that offer that type of job.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Hi Samantha 

*Google Ad sense revenue https://www.google.com/adsense and you tube partner program www.youtube.com/partners 
creating written content, blogging, uploading videos to you tube get paid for clicked ads. 


*Create Digital items 100% profits - e-books, website graphics or backgrounds, royalty free images or music.   


Build a website and make affiliate commissions from visitors clicking ads. 
*Affiliate networks are - commission junction http://www.cj.com find advertisers such as Dell, Canon and Yahoo to advertise on your site. 
*Also http://www.clickbank.com for digital items you can 70% commissions and more. 
*Also http://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com promote eBay items. 
*Also Amazon associates https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/ 


Create a paid members only website / membership subscription - earn monthly recurring payments again 100% profits. 
Learn step-by-step how to build a Membership website for free by visiting http://www.TheProductDeveloper.com and following the video tutorials.
 

Investment for these are: 
Domain names $7.50 / £4.90 each from Godaddy.com - Web hosting hostgator.com $9 / £6.50 a month for unlimited websites. And Time creating content and driving traffic. 


There are so many ways to make money online however these ways all have HIGH profits, very low risk and low start-up costs and each can be used for just about any topic or subject you could think of. So you could go into multiple markets / topics and - spread the risk, if one marketplace were to go slow, others you have will continue to thrive and make money.

*Write down as many topics, subjects and hobbies you can think of and that you enjoy.
Then go to https://adwords.google.co.uk/select/KeywordToolExternal

Use the Google Ad words tool to see what Keywords people are searching for online, type in the topic and see how many people are searching the Internet for that particular topic. 

Choose a keyword for example: scuba diving equipment 

Then go to http://www.seologs.com/keyword-difficulty.html

And type in the keyword to discover how difficult it is to get a good ranking in Google - I would say a difficulty of 40 or less and you&#039;ll have a great chance of getting on page 1. 

Hope this helps 

Kindest
