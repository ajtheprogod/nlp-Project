    <ChosenAnswer>I would have to say Blogger. It helps a lot and you can personalize things easily. Also, Webs.com is where you make your own website. You could make a website about your blog or make a Blog on your website. I know that Webs is very easy to work with along with Blogger. Hope this helps a lot and hope your blog goes well! Good Luck.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I would say www.blogger.com is the best.

Blogger is one of the best blogging sites that I have seen because it has many different features and its as if you make your own personal webpage. Posting new info is a breeze and is really easy. I hope this helps.</Content>

            <Content>I think word-press because the set up is easy to understand and their are many themes to pick ,also it is fairly new so you will have better selection of URLs seeing as all the good ones haven&#039;t been taken yet.</Content>
