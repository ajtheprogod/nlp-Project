    <ChosenAnswer>Well, after the question has been answered, you can add comments to the post, but you have to pull down the &quot;Comments&quot; dropdown and it&#039;s not very easy to find, so there is no way to respond in a way that people will easily notice, unless you send them an email.</ChosenAnswer>
