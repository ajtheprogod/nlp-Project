    <ChosenAnswer>You could try using a different video player, but usually you can&#039;t do much when it&#039;s streaming.  I would recommend installing VLC (www.videolan.org/vlc/) and see if that helps.  If the option is there, download the file and play with VLC, that way you have the option of adjusting the video/sound position.</ChosenAnswer>
