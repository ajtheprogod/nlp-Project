  <Question id="20100311050930AAHdGu1" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Need a good blog name... any suggestions?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m 19, a bit of a nerd (and trekkie), love maths and chem, love heavy metal (especially Finnish melodeath/power/epic/folk), can be a bitch when I feel it&#039;s needed. I love animals. I&#039;m not into things like fashion, make-up, celebrities and I hate twilight. I&#039;m a feminist and an atheist (although I am fascinated by paganism, wiccans and the concept of karma). Basically the blog will be about university life, my family struggles, my friends (or how a bunch of nerds interact socially), my various obsessions, bitching about things that suck, numbers, science, basically anything that comes to mind. 

I&#039;ve thought of some things
The Bitching Hour
Complex Bitch (with bitch spelt with a beta or double benzene ring, imaginary i, T for tangent, complex set C, and a Hydrogen H+)
The Nerd Chronicles
The Daily Sine-er
The Data Complex
Voyager&#039;s Last Word
The Sinthesis of Bitch (Think either sine or Sinergy)
The Queen of Borg
The Queen of Bitch

So any suggestions of names or what things I listed that would look cool would be awesome. Thanks for reading.

I have more if you&#039;re interested. It would be highly appreciated that if you actually ended up using any of these names you would give me proper credit on your blog. It&#039;s only mannerly and fair. Not to mention, just taking the name would be stealing and very rude. You don&#039;t have to tell me if you use any of the names, just give me credit somewhere. Thank you!! :)</Content>
