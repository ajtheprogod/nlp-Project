    <ChosenAnswer>I actually have had three dongles,  vodafone, T Mobile and 3. The best coverage although weaker and slower when receiving than the others is Vodafone. T Mobile is OK and 3 is by far superior as I now have the MiFi dongle which is WIRELESS mobile broadband.

If you go for say a £15 or £20 pm tariff you won&#039;t have to worry about usage as most offer unlimited usage on a fair usage policy. I use my mobile dongle almost endlessly for facebook, downloading images from the net and looking up information from google / yahoo etc and never have any issues with exceeding my usage allowances.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Depends on what is on the page.  I would say you&#039;d average about 1mb or so...However, chances are not everything would change on each reload and the computer would reload the images from cache and just reload changed text so that&#039;d only be a couple hundred kilobytes or less.</Content>
