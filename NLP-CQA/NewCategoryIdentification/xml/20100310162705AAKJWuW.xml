  <Question id="20100310162705AAKJWuW" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why do websites like walmart or bestbuy always lag?</Subject>
    <Content>walmart.ca/com and bestbuy.ca/com always lag
There are many other websites that lag and I find this very annoying. Is it only me?
Also the toys r us website does this as well as many other store websites.

    <ChosenAnswer>Perhaps you should try clearing your browser&#039;s cookies and cache and then try to visit the websites again.

If that doesn&#039;t work, perhaps you should try repairing your connection by going tot he Control Panel and then to Network and Internet Connections.

From there, you should right click on your connection and choose &quot;Repair&quot;.

If that still doesn&#039;t work, perhaps you should try resetting your router by unplugging it for about fifteen seconds or so and then plugging it back in.

Good luck and I hope I helped you!</ChosenAnswer>
