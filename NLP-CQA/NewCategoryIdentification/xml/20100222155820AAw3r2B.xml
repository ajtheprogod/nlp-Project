  <Question id="20100222155820AAw3r2B" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Best hosting on the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>What do you think is the best hosting service on the internet in terms of having a cheap price, customer support, 99.9% uptime, ..? Do you think JustHost is good?
Mind you, I already tried 000webhost and I think their free version is great, but now that I am switching to paid hosting, I am researching my options.

            <Content>JustHost is one of the better ones.

I recommend one of these: http://www.tophostingpicks.com

iPage has the best offer right now.
Their standard price is $84/year ($6.95) but they have
a 50% sale, one year of hosting for $42.00.

Their plan includes:

Unlimited disk space
Unlimited bandwidth
Free domain name

Price: $42/year ($3.50)

They have one of the most popular hosting platforms, which currently hosts over a million websites. They&#039;re also one of the oldest hosting companies, founded in 1998.</Content>
