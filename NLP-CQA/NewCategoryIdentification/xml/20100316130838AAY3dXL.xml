  <Question id="20100316130838AAY3dXL" type="Answered">
    <Subject>extremely important! i&#039;m concerned for my safety!!! (internet)?</Subject>
    <Content>about a year ago i was on this website, called &quot;nextornot.com&quot; and i would talk to alot of guys just be flirty, never sent &quot;bad&quot; pics, but they could see a few photos of me... not bad or anything though, just face shots, and i never gave any information, only my first name thats it. 

and so on facebook i got a friend request from one of the guys i talked to and i was wondering how he found me!! but i havent talked to that guy for like a year! and i havent been on that website for a year. But i just got really scared and freaked out... so i blocked him, removed him from friends, because for a little while i didnt recognize him, then after i realized, i did that... 

i changed all my privacy settings to everything can only be seen by friends... 

is there anything else i need to do to be safe from this guy? 

and he is older than me he is like 20 and im 15!! when i first talked to him he told me he was 16!! so i got SUPER freaked! 

but i still feel like he might stalk me or something, becasue i was  friends w/ him on facebook for 2 days b4 i blocked him, he can do alot in the short time! he could of found my school, and contact info... and apparently he lives close to me!!

what do i do!! im kinda freaked, thanks!
if i tell my parents, they will kno i was on that sight talking to stangers on the internet, and trust me i know its wrong i learned that like a year ago when i canceled my account for that site... yea lol

    <ChosenAnswer>You could change your screen name and make it something funny instead of your real name or you can change your profile pic to something with a large group of friends so they can&#039;t tell which ones you or make your profile pic something like just your eye,or i think there a privacy setting on facebook that ,if you don&#039;t want to ever be searched by someone you can take that off and only you can search people. But so far what youve done is good too.hope this helps!</ChosenAnswer>
