  <Question id="20100304182844AA0J3E2" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is giving false information in those &quot;offers&quot; illegal?</Subject>
    <Content>A friend of my sister&#039;s friends was doing one of those offer things (WIN $500 now! Just enter your information...) to get like virtual money on some website. He entered the wrong information and like a Wal-Mart&#039;s phone number from some other state as his home phone. I laughed at it, but I was wondering if he could get into trouble by doing that, especially if something weird was sent to another person&#039;s address or if that Wal-Mart got really pissed. So, is it illegal, or just something really stupid?
Sorry.. I&#039;m a bit OCD. I meant to say a friend of my sister&#039;s* :|
Ha. I probably sound like an idiot. I was just curious. I didn&#039;t think they were, but I guess you never know. I don&#039;t do them. I&#039;m not giving my information out. :)

    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s legal. Those are illegal scam to begin with so they couldn&#039;t press charges. If they harassed that Walmart, it would be the scammers who got in trouble, not you.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>No it&#039;s not illegal.
Since those offers aren&#039;t legal to begin with, and misleading.

Just make sure you don&#039;t put in your real information.</Content>
