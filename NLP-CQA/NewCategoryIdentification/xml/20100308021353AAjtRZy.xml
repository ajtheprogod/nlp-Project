    <ChosenAnswer>I offer is a legitimate site, I&#039;ve been selling items on there for over two years, I don&#039;t recommend anyone buying from outside of their country as there has been reports that people have ordered iphones, cellphones,etc and gotten a cheap plastic necklace or something similar in the mail, since they used the tracking information for shipping, it&#039;s your word against theirs. So I do recommend you to take extreme precaution when ordering items on there.</ChosenAnswer>
