    <ChosenAnswer>I personally use firefox. I love the ability to use all the customizable addons and everything. 

I don&#039;t use internet explorer, because its to simplistic in its look and feel, its not customizable for shit, and i just don&#039;t like to support microsoft more than i already do.

As for chrome, i can&#039;t say ive used it a whole lot, but its security is good, and has decent add-ons and everything, but it seems to have the simplicity related to IE. 

Overall i like firefox layout customization, protection add-ons, and over look and layout!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Firefox is most safe... it checks everything on viruses and trojans and it doesn&#039;t freeze all the time like explorer does.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>I agree with the first answer. I use firefox.
reasons:
¤ie is horrible, terribly slow, its full of holes and I don&#039;t like endorsing ms anymore than I have to.
¤ chrome is meant to be fast but for me it is slower than Firefox. I also don&#039;t like the theme it has, it looks boring and not like a traditional browser. That is why back in the day so many people went to Firefox - because it had a similar feel to ie.
¤opera is great on mobiles but takes over my pc on the windows application and is slightly annoying.
¤never tried safari.
¤konquorer was alright, but I don&#039;t use Linux anymore so I don&#039;t use it.
¤i&#039;ve also made my own browser but its pretty crappy at the moment so I use Firefox.</Content>
