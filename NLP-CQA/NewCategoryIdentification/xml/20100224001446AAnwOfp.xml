  <Question id="20100224001446AAnwOfp" type="Answered">
    <Subject>If I have a protected Twitter acct, can celebrities I follow see what I tweet?</Subject>
    <Content>I want to protect my tweets from noisy friends. Can I tweet without the  @ function and my tweet will still be seen by the celebrity or do they have to follow me inorder to see any of my tweets that don&#039;t include their name in it. Like I tweet &quot;I had a good day&quot; and tweet &quot;@kobebryant I hope you had a good day.&quot; Can he see both tweets or just the message directed to him even if I am following him but he is not following me.
