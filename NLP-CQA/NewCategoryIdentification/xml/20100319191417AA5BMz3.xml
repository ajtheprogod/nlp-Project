    <ChosenAnswer>make and model of your laptop and router will help.

anyway lets make it generic:
1. assuming you&#039;ve configured you router properly then you router status should say you internet connection is active or you may see it from lights of your router (internet or WAN)

2. On your laptop&#039;s wireless manager you must see your newly created SID or the name of your wifi.

3. Connect to it and provide your security details if there is any.

step one is very important. 
good luck</ChosenAnswer>
