    <ChosenAnswer>Hello LyricxTOlife,
I, too, tried poemhunter, but didn&#039;t get anywhere, either.  So, what I did was go to a library, find the
&quot;Poetry&quot; section, and look at the names of each publisher.  Then I wrote to as many publishers as I could (depending on whether or not I was able to find a complete address), until I started getting responses.   I finally found a publisher who was willing to take a chance on an &quot;unknown&quot;!!!  [...I also
tried entering several poetry contests----they are just a waste of time...]</ChosenAnswer>
