    <ChosenAnswer>4chan itself isn&#039;t so bad, although the massive amount of images uploaded daily is good.  Although there most notorious, and popular, board /b/ (or random) has called the &#039;asshole of the internet&#039; by encyclopedia dramatica. The /b/ board has no rules, and the people there just try to post the most shocking images or gruesome etc.  /b/ is also responsible for creating many internet memes, such as rick-rolling and lolcats.  If I were you, I wouldn&#039;t get into reading /b/, it&#039;s effed up.</ChosenAnswer>
