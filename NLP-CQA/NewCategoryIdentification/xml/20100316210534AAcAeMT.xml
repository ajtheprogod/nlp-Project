    <ChosenAnswer>Anytime you want to work on something say a project, you can open every page you need to work on it . It just allows you to work offline on your stuff and like you said, it keeps you from using someone&#039;s bandwidth for a long period of time. This keeps the site&#039;s you get your info from happy and because your not using any of their bandwidth and it is more secure for you to do this not being online</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Some older computers used IE as a picture viewer, so someone without an internet connection could still use it for that purpose. Also, if your designing a website on a computer that doesn&#039;t have internet access (maybe a laptop while not at home) you can preview it with either browser.</Content>
