    <Subject>Streaming Video Problem?</Subject>
    <Content>When i try to view a video from websites like youtube, a warning comes up saying that I do not have the latest Adobe&#039;s Flash Player and must download it for me to be able to watch the video. However when i do click the link to download and install Adobe, a virus threat pops out saying that the installer has viruses. Does any one have a virus free solution?

            <Content>Hello my friend,

Go here to download Adobe Flash: 

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
 
A lot of times however, its not the case, and it may just be a virus. Try running an antivirus, like Malwarebytes (http://www.malwarebytes.org/)

Also, try using a different internet explorer. Try using Google Chrome, my personal favorite after moving from Firefox, has a lot less issues like this.

Good luck my friend, hopefully I helped!</Content>

            <Content>true you should download the flash player from a legit site but your antivirus may still pose as a problem and may stop your videos from streaming ( kaspersky has done this before). so if your videos still arent working go to your anti virus and disable the web antivirus (only. do not touch your virus scanners)</Content>
