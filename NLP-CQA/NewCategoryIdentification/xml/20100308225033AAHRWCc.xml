    <ChosenAnswer>Some people like to buy lenses that other people have written because they don&#039;t want to do it themselves.

However, it&#039;s not hard to create your own lens yourself, for free. You can write about (almost) anything you like, to promote a website, or spread the word, or sell products and make money.</ChosenAnswer>
