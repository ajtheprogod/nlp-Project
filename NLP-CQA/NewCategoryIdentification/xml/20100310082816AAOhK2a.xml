  <Question id="20100310082816AAOhK2a" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is the best proxy website?</Subject>
    <Content>I need a website that will let me log into MySpace and send messages. All of the ones that I&#039;ve found will not send messages. Preferable one with the least amount of pop-up. The website link cannot have the name MySpace, FaceBook, Or Gaia in it. If It does it won&#039;t work. And PLEASE free. I&#039;m poor. &gt;.&lt; It&#039;s really important. If you wanna know the reason send me an e-mail. =D I like to share happy stories. Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>I tried hundreds of free proxies/vpn&#039;s over many months. All I got out of it was a lot of frustration as they got blocked in short order. Well I got one more thing and that was a virus from one of them that wrecked my HD. Even when they worked for a while they were slow and didn&#039;t support all the web site features. My friend in Riyadh told me about the Personal VPN http://www.surfbouncer.com.  He&#039;s kind of an expert on unblocking sites because he lives in a place where pretty much everything fun is blocked.

Anyway, I tried it a few months ago and it&#039;s been working all the time. I haven&#039;t been blocked since and the sites are 100% functional. With the Personal VPN everything works like it&#039;s supposed to. Once connected you don&#039;t even know it&#039;s there. It&#039;s not free but it works perfectly.</ChosenAnswer>
