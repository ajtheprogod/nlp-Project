    <Subject>Ebay Shipping Options?</Subject>
    <Content>I am planning sell a yugioh card on eBay. I plan to mail it in a top-loader in a normal envelope with a stamp. When choosing the shipping options which is the one that I would choose? I know its none of the Priority Mail flat rate options but I don&#039;t know which is the option for normal mail.

    <ChosenAnswer>It depends which mailer you use, if you use a Priority Mail mailer and it clearly says &quot;Priority&quot; then you will pay the postal charge on the shipment.
It however is wise to go for First class plain mailer and wrap the card with two thin pieces of card board, or 3x5 index cards and then plastic wrap and tape, to protect the card from bending mark it Do Not Bend and then place in the mailer.
First class mail is far cheaper and you can save at least $0.80 per mailer with it.
If you are selling I would suggest you mark your item Flat Rate Postage online and take the cheapest way out you can, you can get mailers at any store that are plain and if you do need supplies like Priority Mailers Check the eBay/Pay Pal/ USPS links for free mailers delivered to you.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>first class is correct - make sure you do online (paypal) and get the delivery confirmation. If its really valuable you may want to insure (ebay no longer allows you to charge for insurance)</Content>
