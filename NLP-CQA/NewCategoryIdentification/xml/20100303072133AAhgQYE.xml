    <ChosenAnswer>Possibly it&#039;s just the profile disappeared. Look in your control panel and click on Network Connections.  Have you tried to create a new connection? When you do it will pop up a Wizard that will take you through the steps. Also make sure the driver for your LAN card is still there. You may need to reinstall the driver.

Hope this helps!</ChosenAnswer>
