    <ChosenAnswer>Experienced eBay sellers consider it to be very suspicious if they are requested to ship the goods anywhere other than the bidders registered address.
Many sellers are not willing to ship worldwide due to the high level of dishonesty - people receive the goods and then claim the goods never arrived.  The seller has lost his goods AND been forced to refund the money to the dishonest buyer</ChosenAnswer>
