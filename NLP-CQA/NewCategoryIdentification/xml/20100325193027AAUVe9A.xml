    <Subject>FireFox 3.6.2 freezes up... a lot?</Subject>
    <Content>I upgraded when 3.6.2 came out a couple days ago, and since then FireFox has been acting absolutely terribly.  I get these momentary freeze-ups; where nothing will happen for two or three seconds, and then suddenly everything I was trying to do will happen all at once.  These happen four or five times a minute.  It affects every aspect of the Internet.

I do not have these problems with IE or Chrome.  It&#039;s just the newest version of FireFox.  Also I have Windows Vista if that helps.

    <ChosenAnswer>I used to be a HUGH fan of FF, but the newer versions have all gone south. It takes me over 30 seconds to open the latest version without any addon&#039;s. Chrome on the other hand take about 2. (Uninstalled IE long back) 

I&#039;ve jumped ship now, you should do the same, until Mozilla realize their mistakes and go back to making a great browser.</ChosenAnswer>
