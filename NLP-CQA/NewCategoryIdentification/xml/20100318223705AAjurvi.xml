        <Answer>
            <Content>If you have information that you want to share about a subject matter, niche or product or service, than you need an audience; on Twitter they are called followers.

The key to getting followers in Twitter is by following others.  However, you probably don&#039;t want to follow just anybody.  You want to follow people who are interested in the things that you are interested in.  So make a list of 7 keywords of things that you are interested in and then watch this video about how to sign-up for a free Twitter application that will allow you to follow people using your keywords.  Due to the fact that you are following people that share an interest, there is a high probability that they will follow you back.
