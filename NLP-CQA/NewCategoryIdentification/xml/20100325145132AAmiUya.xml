    <Subject>Lockerz prices and ptz amounts?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m thinking of joining Lockerz, and I want to know how much stuff costs (2 or 3 examples please) and how many points you get (on average) per day. I heard you get points from polls or something, how much is this?

thanks in advance
