    <Subject>Ebay seller scammed me for 5000$ is there anything i can do?? Details inside!?</Subject>
    <Content>here is how it went down. the ebay seller had 100% feedback over 500 items sold. they were selling a camera that i bought for just over 5,000$. they then took the money, cashed it out to their bank account. never sent the item, then (according to paypal) they removed their bank account and debit card from their paypal. closed down their paypal account. i have tried contacting them and nothing. they live all the way across the country. is there anything that can really be done? or am i just out of 5k here?
thanks for all the input. and no it is a 15000$ camera that are used at stadium football games. so 5000$ was a great buy.
