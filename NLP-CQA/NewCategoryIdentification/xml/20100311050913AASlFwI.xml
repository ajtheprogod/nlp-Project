    <Subject>Trouble installing Google Earth?</Subject>
    <Content>After downloading the installer from http://earth.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=21955# for a direct installation, I run GoogleEarthWin.exe.  The installation completes and there&#039;s a popup thanking me for installing Google Earth.  But then I can&#039;t find it anywhere!  

Where is it hiding or wasn&#039;t it installed?  Is it not compatible with Windows 7?

Thanks.
Thanks!

It&#039;s not in programs, unfortunately.  

That must be the problem.  I&#039;ve got the 64 bit version.  I assume nothing was installed then and that there is nothing to uninstall?

    <ChosenAnswer>From what i have found, it is not possible to have it run on Windows 7 at a 64 bit rate.  You may just have to give them time to make a 64 bit version. you could also e-mail their help.</ChosenAnswer>
