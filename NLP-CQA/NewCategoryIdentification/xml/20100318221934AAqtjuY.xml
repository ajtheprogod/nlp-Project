    <ChosenAnswer>Yeah I have the same thing, its something to do with your network connection. I have ADSL &amp; when I use the USB cable I get the X saying Local Area connection - a networkcable is unplugged but if I use the ethernet cable I dont get that message.  (I have to share my cables if you are wondering why I dont use both) Hope that makes some sense, anyway so long as it works Im happy :)</ChosenAnswer>
