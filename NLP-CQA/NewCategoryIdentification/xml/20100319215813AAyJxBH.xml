    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s actually a public tracker but it&#039;s classed as a private site due to the invite system.
It opens the doors to the public every now and then but normally it&#039;s invite only.
In my opinion it&#039;s the best public tracker around but I&#039;m sure opinions will differ on this. My main reason for saying this is that dupes, fakes and infected files are quickly removed so it&#039;s definitely the safest public tracker.
Oh and for the record there&#039;s nothing illegal about the BitTorrent protocol, what is illegal is the sharing of copyrighted material.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>demonoid is a great torrent site much like isohunt or thepiratebay. demonoid is a highly respected site in the fact that it only has quality torrents. the only problem is, its a private site. only with a reference code from one of its members can you get in. you can find many torrents that were taken from there. if you look in the info thats supplied with the download many come from demonoid.</Content>
