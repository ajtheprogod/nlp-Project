            <Content>Refurbished refers to articles/products that are re-conditioned as in , they are repaired if any faulty parts are found.

Used articles are sold directly as it is,i.e. it is not repaired and it is condition as it was given from the previous owner of the item.</Content>

        <Answer>
            <Content>Refurbished means that someone returned the product because something was wrong with it. The manufacturers then took it, fixed whatever was wrong and put it back up for sale for a lower price. Most of the time, there&#039;s nothing wrong with refurbished stuff, but you always take that chance. Used means that someone opened the box and returned the item for whatever reason (too expensive, not what they wanted, etc.). They may or may not have actually used the product and there&#039;s probably nothing wrong with it. But since the box was opened, they can&#039;t sell it as new anymore.</Content>
