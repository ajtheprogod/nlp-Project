    <Subject>Easy Twitter question?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m new to Twitter, so I&#039;m not familiar with much.
I was wondering, when someone talks to you, like &quot;@[your username]&quot; how can you tell?  Do you get notified somehow?
I never see that people are trying to talk to me until I search my username.
How can I tell when someones talking to me?

Sorry, I&#039;m a newbie.
