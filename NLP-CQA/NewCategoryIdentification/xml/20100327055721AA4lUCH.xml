    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s working for me too, although I thought it wasn&#039;t for awhile. This is the trick: You have to wait a few minutes before you connect to peers. At first all of the torrents were sitting at 0/0 and I would assume they weren&#039;t going to work. But then I left one instead of deleting it while I went to look for alternates, and it started up. It went nice and quick, too. Just be patient for a few minutes, and it should work for you. 

Although, I have heard that the service has been completely blocked from several countries, most of them European. I&#039;m in Canada, so this doesn&#039;t effect me. Wikipedia has more information on the matter.</ChosenAnswer>
