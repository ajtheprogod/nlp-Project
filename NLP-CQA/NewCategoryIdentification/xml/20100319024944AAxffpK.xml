  <Question id="20100319024944AAxffpK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I stop woome.com sending myself and my friends emails when my account has been deactivated?</Subject>
    <Content>I wrote a similar question a few weeks ago and a lady from woome.com suggested that I log-on and raise a support ticket. Sadly my account has been deactivated, so I can&#039;t actually log-on. I also can&#039;t find an email address to mail the support guys directly. I assumed that deactivation would cease all activity. That is the assumed behaviour of deactivation isn&#039;t it!? Its incredible that websites can get away with spamming activity such as this.

    <ChosenAnswer>Hey there, 

I&#039;m that lady from WooMe.com, my name is Veronica, pleased to meet you! However, I&#039;m sorry that you&#039;re frustrated. 

We do have our contact information posted across the WooMe website. However, you can email me directly at community at woome dot com to tell me the email address you used to upload your contacts to WooMe from and I will purge your information and the contacts you uploaded from our system. 

Because the invites were sent out before you deactivated, certain people will continue to receive contact from us based on their interest in the WooMe site. I&#039;m sorry if this surprised you. We&#039;re happy to remove all information and will address this as soon as we get your email. 


hope that helps.
