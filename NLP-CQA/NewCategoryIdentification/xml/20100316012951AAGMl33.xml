  <Question id="20100316012951AAGMl33" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Google AdSense &amp; Chitika?</Subject>
    <Content>Using Google AdSense and Chitika to place ads on my site, how much can I expect to earn from each visitor?

I have to make a budget on my income, and I have no idea how big of a difference e.g. 1 000, 10 000 or 100 000 visitors will make for the income.

The site is not launched yet and has a low budget, so I guess we&#039;ll start at the bottom of the hierarchy (if that makes any sense...)

    <ChosenAnswer>You will not make money on each visitor... the volume of your income will depend on your traffic volume. Typically the AdSense &amp; Chitika conversion for a startup website is about .30% (in my experience) .. that means that if you get 1000 visitors you could get about 300 click .. and if each click pays about .05 / click .. you make about 15$ / day...</ChosenAnswer>
