    <Subject>Points2Shop- Any tips on what I should do before I sign up?</Subject>
    <Content>I understand that Points2Shop is a totally legit site, and any users rave about it. It is also a offer site, and I am not sure on the exact definition of an offer site. 

Will this site, once I answer offers, allow third-party companies to send me more Spam mail in my real-life mailbox, or just a my email? 

If it is the latter, I&#039;ll just make a new email address. I do not want any more junk mail sent to my house, but will that happen? Thanks for ANY help.

    <ChosenAnswer>Most regular offers won&#039;t send you anything in the mail since the cost of postage is so much nowadays.  The offers that might send you something in the mail are the &quot;Medical Offers&quot; labeled [PD] (which stands for Pharmacy Daily).  They usually send a brochure for the medical offer it has you complete.  

As for your e-mail, you can create new ones to use for &quot;spam e-mails&quot; so your regular account doesn&#039;t get all that spam!  Just make sure it&#039;s an e-mail you really create, no temp e-mails as those can get your account banned.  

Also, if you are worried about telemarketers calling your house you might want to check out sites like www.k7.net , they give you a phone number you can use for offers so your phone isn&#039;t ringing off the hook (this service is FREE).  

Finally, check out http://www.points2shophelp.com There is a lot of good info there on how to get credit on offers, videos on how to do offers, and just tips in general for making money on Points2Shop.  Hope this helps!  :D</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I would&#039;nt use points2shop because most of those surveys require street adress, etc. Lokcerz and swagbucks are good!</Content>
