    <Subject>Why don&#039;t people see this is like virtual shoplifting?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m amazed by the number of questions pertaining to getting complex expensive shareware for free.  You cannot walk into a computer store, pick up a piece of software and walk out with it without paying.  Why do people think they can do this on the web - and even ask total strangers how to do it?
You sell your current item to get money to create the next item.  It is how the world works.
If people are stealing your item, you are not getting any money back to use to create the next item, and so either there will be no next item or else it will be priced higher to compensate for all the thieves taking it for free.
Stealing shareware means higher prices for those purchasing in the future.

    <ChosenAnswer>Nah, they just tell you that the price is higher to compensate for theft, so that they can make more profit.
Think about it, the person that stole it wouldn&#039;t have bought it anyway, if there was no way of stealing it.

            <Content>Hey, don&#039;t care.

Companies problem, not ours.

Why don&#039;t you stop complaining on the internet and go do something about it instead of telling people it&#039;s &#039;wrong&#039;.</Content>
