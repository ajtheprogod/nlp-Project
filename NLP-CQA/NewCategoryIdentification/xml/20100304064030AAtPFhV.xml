    <ChosenAnswer>You deal with each Ebay listing individually.  Ebay does not have a shopping cart.  If a listing has multiple quantities for sale, there&#039;s a box for you to enter the quantity you want to buy before you click the buy button.  If you buy multiple items from the same seller, request an invoice before you pay them.  They can and usually will combine shipping costs, saving you a lot of money.  Also, that way you only have to enter your payment information once instead of for all of the individual listings.</ChosenAnswer>
