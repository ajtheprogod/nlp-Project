  <Question id="20100324153127AAOhctn" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is the virus really gone?</Subject>
    <Content>I had a virus blocked and killed off by Webroot Antivirus, I believe it was called &quot;MAL/JDSP&quot; or something (I know it had the prefix &quot;mal/&quot; and the letters &quot;D&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;P&quot; in some order). It disabled my audio, and even after Webroot killed it off, my sound was disabled and I had to go to Administrative Tools and manually restart the Windows Audio service. Does this mean that Webroot DIDN&#039;T totally remove the virus, or does it mean it DID remove it, but didn&#039;t &quot;know&quot; I needed that Audio service back?

Thanks for the info &amp; advice, Bill!
(though once I restarted the Audio service, which had in fact been stopped by the virus, my computer went back to normal and I can use iTunes and such again!)

    <ChosenAnswer>I agree, the fact that the sound is working again is a good sign. But, you can try running the Malicious Software Removal Tool and see if it finds any viruses (if for nothing else, to give you peace of mind): http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.aspx.

            <Content>If your sound is working without any further problems, I would say the virus is gone, if you are still have problems with the sound, then running a full scan never hurts to really be sure.</Content>
