    <Subject>How to make AIM 7 dock to the side of the screen?</Subject>
    <Content>I just upgraded to the new version of AIM.

I had the old version set to &quot;dock&quot; on the left edge of the screen, so even though it wouldn&#039;t always be on top (and getting in my way), I&#039;d still be able to see it.

But I can&#039;t figure out how to do that now on the new version. Can anyone please help me out?
Thanks!!!

PS: I have Windows Vista if it matters.
YOU ARE WONDERFUL!!! THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!
