    <ChosenAnswer>The safest way is to go to individual websites where they give away music for free. Anytime you deal with websites with a lot of traffic you open yourself up to viruses, spyware, adware, etc. Here is a hip-hop/rap artist&#039;s website with free downloads to get you started.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yup.  The Zune Pass is one such website.  Keep in mind that you can only truly own 10 songs a month with the service, so if you cancel the service your music stops working except for the 10 songs you keep.</Content>
