    <ChosenAnswer>ping some numerical IP address and see if works. 

eg: ping 66.249.91.104

If it works, you just need to fix your nameserver addresses. You most likely made a typographical error when entering them or something. Or maybe you have DHCP enabled in your OS but turned off in your router or something trivial like that.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Try to restore your computer back before it happened. If all fails use your software to reboot. If you delete that file it will cost you about $125 to buy it at Office Max, etc because its not a free down load</Content>
