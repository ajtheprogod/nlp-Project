  <Question id="20100228131527AA9oLBl" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I turn on HTML on a  website?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m trying to buy a Wine Case as a gift for a friend from the Tesco Website and for some reason, all the pages are only viewable as basic text.....
What can I do to turn on HTML as its really horrid to navigate as is :(

This is the main tesco site, which is how the Wine site &quot;should&quot; look as well.
http://www.tesco.com/

But this is how the wine site is looking for me :(
http://i62.photobucket.com/albums/h110/kliskey/tescowine.jpg

This is a direct link to the site:
http://www.tesco.com/wine/

If its looking normal for you, then what do you suggest I do? I&#039;ve emptied cookies and it made no difference :(

Cheers in advance,
Klis
Should have perhaps mentioned...
I have the latest version of Chrome and all up-to-date updates for most adjoining webapps such as flash etc etc

I reccomend restart your computer. If that doesn&#039;t work, use a different internet browser (if you&#039;re using internet explorer, download and use firefox for example)

Any more assistance needed, reply/pm me.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Be sure you have JavaScript enabled. Also, if you are using internet explorer be sure you are in the latest version which now is 8. Also, download the free firefox and/or chrome browsers. They are better. You should have no problems with those.</Content>

            <Content>it looks like that because your browser didn&#039;t load the site&#039;s stylesheets so the website gets displayed as you saw it(this happens to me from time to time but I usually refresh the page and everything looks normal then);

your cookie files have nothing to do with this, instead you should clear your browser&#039;s cache.</Content>
