  <Question id="20100225191708AAyWavd" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can&#039;t access website, could someone help me get this in?</Subject>
    <Content>I need to get some information on breastfeeding benefits for mother and baby on 4women.gov. The problem is that the site is not working for me (I&#039;m out of the country and that is the only thing I can think of that is causing this). If someone could take a screen shot of the lists benefiting mother and baby or do a copy and paste thing and just send that to my email or post it in the answers that would be really helpful.
