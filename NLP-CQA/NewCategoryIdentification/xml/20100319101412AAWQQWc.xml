    <Subject>I sold an item on eBay that got damaged after the listing ended, how do I cancel it?</Subject>
    <Content>A day after selling the item (leather shoes), we had a flood in our basement and the shoes are pretty much ruined. The buyer hasn&#039;t paid as they told me they were going to pay on Saturday, it&#039;s only Friday. Anyways, I mailed the buyer and told them about it. Now, what&#039;s the next step?

    <ChosenAnswer>Has the buyer replied yet?  
You could sent them a request to cancel the transaction, the buyer needs to agree to this before ebay would consider the transaction closed &amp; refund your FVF. I think the buyer can also still leave feedback.</ChosenAnswer>
