    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;ve been a loyal member to Demonoid for quite a while now, and I&#039;m not so sure your ratio matters (I have a 1.39 ratio). Since their big crash back in the fall, I think they eliminated early invite codes for those users newer than 2008. That&#039;s the only thing I can rule in for this situation. Too many new users were abusing the privileges and now only those with seniority on the site get the extra benefits. It worked for me just now, so go to your user control panel and click &quot;Create a new invitation code&quot;. It should spit one out, but if you&#039;ve been a member for less than 6 months, you won&#039;t be able to. They make sure you&#039;re going to stick around and not just spam them with new members. They closed off registration for a reason. :P</ChosenAnswer>

Not sure on the invite code, I thought you had to request one, or donate.</Content>
