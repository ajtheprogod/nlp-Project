    <ChosenAnswer>Don&#039;t know where you get from his feedback that he has changed his address to Spain?
You must only send to the address in Paypal (and tracked or Paypal seller cover is negated anyway ) 
Why do you feel the need to not send to the address in Paypal (you think it is wrong)
The Buyer may not log into ebay for many days (so ring him) 
The longer you hold onto it the lower his estimation of your service will be 
If you send tracked you will be covered (and all the emails you sent him. he could not complain)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Only send to the Paypal registered address. If you send anywhere else and it doesn&#039;t get there, Paypal will certainly refund him.

He needs to add his Spanish addy to Paypoo.</Content>
