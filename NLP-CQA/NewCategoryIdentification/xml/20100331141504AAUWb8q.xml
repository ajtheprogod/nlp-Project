  <Question id="20100331141504AAUWb8q" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Anyone know of websites similar to listentoamovie.com?</Subject>
    <Content>I work in a cube and do a lot of mundane typing work, dealing with claims and billing, so it&#039;s a very repetitive task that leaves me bored out of my mind. Listening to music remedies this, but I have also found a website called www.listentoamovie.com where there are actual movies you can listen to via streaming, no need to download anything. It&#039;s nice for me, because it provides something other than music and since it&#039;s too distracting to watch a movie while at work, this was perfect.

Problem is I&#039;ve worked here for a few years now, and I&#039;ve listened to just about every movie on there and they don&#039;t update their website it seems. Does anyone know of a similar website that offers streaming of movies? I&#039;m most interested if there are places where I can listen to episodes of shows like The Office, The Simpsons, Family Guy, etc. Thanks!
