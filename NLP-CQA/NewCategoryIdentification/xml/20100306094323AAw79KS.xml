            <Content>If he has been clean for 5 months, than he has no need for crank powder, unless he wants to get hooked. Tell him that the meth craving will pass eventually and crank powder can only be harmful. After all, even if it is legal, it is still probably harmful. I am pretty sure that the website itself is a scam.</Content>
