    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s really better to post your own content to get a feel for what it&#039;s like.

That way when your outsourcers has a question you can answer it with authority.

            <Content>I agree with Lisa, outsourcing comes much later. First you must create useful content yourself. If your current blog is about something you&#039;re not passionate about then choose some other topic you have passion for. Try to focus on spreading the word first, the more people know about your blog better, and don&#039;t be bothered about revenue. In a blog&#039;s life cycle, revenue from ads comes after a readership is created. Use Traffic Exchangers to spread the word. Work actively on Social networking too.</Content>
