  <Question id="20100324140419AA4tM8R" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there an English website with a biography on Dr. Gerhard Stalling?</Subject>
    <Content>Dr. Gerhard Stalling founded the first guide dog school for the blind. I&#039;m doing a project on guide dogs for the blind and I need to write a biography on him and I can&#039;t find one ANYWHERE! I don&#039;t want a website about how he was walking with a soldier and his dog... I need an actual biography on his life! Please! I need this for school! If you know anything about him then write it here, I need all the help I can get!

    <ChosenAnswer>Go to your library and a librarian for help. The internet is not the only source of information, a fact which seems to be lost on students these days. Public libraries have more than just books. There are also periodical catalogs and subscription-based databases that can help you find information.</ChosenAnswer>
