    <Subject>QUestion concerning about PAyPal problem!!!!?!?!!? HELP!?</Subject>
    <Content>What to do in this situation......??

Recently I was scammed into thinking that I would get an 100 itunes gift card for 90 bucks.....now I was told to give the seller $90 through paypal and make it send to his email and making it say &quot;Payment Owed&quot;. So I did all this and sent it. Within couple minutes I realized that he was a scammer so I disputed it with Paypal!!!! I am right now waiting for paypal response but what do you think of my chances of getting a refund???

His paypal btw was unverified and new member.........so keep that in mind. You think I would get my money back?

Also some poeple said I should try my credit card company?? But what i did was through my PNC Virtual Wallet bank account....it wasent paid directly through the credit card (which is a debit card).

SO what do you think of my chances of getting my refund back?? Also what if the seller doesn&#039;t respond, do i get it??

Please help!!! WILL GIVE BEST

    <ChosenAnswer>Hi
First of all the deal seems too good to be true....and it seems that it was. 
How did you purchase these, where they through ebay or an auction site?

How do you know that the seller was a scammer?

It seems that the person has just opened the account and then gone. 
Have you contacted the seller directly?

As you paid by your bank account, I would contact them and explain what has happened. 
They could reimbust you.

In future, I would suggest that you pay by credit card. 

Good Luck getting your money back.</ChosenAnswer>
