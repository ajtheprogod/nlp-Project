            <Content>That would depend on how you have paypal setup. Typically you are given the option of choosing your credit card or bank account on file as sources for the funds. Paypal then immediately takes the funds, and brings it into paypal, then immediately pats the merchant. 

The reason why i say its how you set it up, is I have made mistakes in past about not checking whether or not it was my business checking, or my personal checking.. and it has been bad before! :P

Moral of the story...Always make sure its coming from the right fund source.</Content>

            <Content>You go to the PayPal site, login and then transfer funds from your bank account into your PayPal account, this takes several days. PayPal will show you a balance just like a bank statement, and will confirm when the money is in there. Then when you&#039;re buying from E-Bay, you can pay directly with PayPal (assuming you have transferred enough money into PayPal).</Content>

            <Content>You dont have to transfer funds from your account to paypal although its probably better for you if you did as this will be an instant payment to the seller (therefore a quicker transaction for you both). If you funded your purchase without transferring the funds, paypal will still take the funds from your bank account but the payment wont be instant. (If you have a credit card on file, payment is instant even if you do fund your purchases through your bank account) Hope that makes sense.</Content>
