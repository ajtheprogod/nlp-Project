  <Question id="20100325130447AABSndu" type="Answered">
    <Subject>On Twitter, will people see my @replies?</Subject>
    <Content>If I @reply someone, it doesn&#039;t show up if I go and search @thatperson to see all their @replies. Will they still see my reply anyways even though it doesn&#039;t show up on the timeline when I search it? It should still be under their @replies, right?
okay, here&#039;s what i mean. for example, i sent a reply to Jeffrey Sparkman. So I sent @jeffreysparkman blahblahblahblah. I searched @jeffreysparkman to see all the people that replied to him, and it&#039;s only been a few in the past few hours, but my reply did not show up when i searched it. will he still see my reply to him?

            <Content>When you reply to someone with an @, people can see it by viewing your page. It will not show in their feed. Other people will NOT see your replies to other people on THEIR pages, however.</Content>
