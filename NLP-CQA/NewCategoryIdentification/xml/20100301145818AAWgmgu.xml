    <Subject>MY INTERNET I SOOOOOOOOOOO SLOW?</Subject>
    <Content>alright, i&#039;m with Bell for my internet, and ever since last night, my internet has been HORRID. no ones downloading anything in my house, and right now, the internet is being used for my xbox (but not even playing online) by brother on msn, and me, on yahoo answers. this should not make my internet this slow! any idea on what&#039;s going on? Maybe something on Bell&#039;s end? if it is, what are they doing? Because this happens to me like 3 times a month. It&#039;s so bad that i&#039;d have to wait 30 minutes just to load a youtube video that 3 1/2 minutes long
@ ymaster

    <ChosenAnswer>There are MANY reasons for computer slow downs:
 not enough memory
 too many programs starting up with windows at boot up time
 too many junk files
 too many restore points

Clean windows registry can speed up the computer.
Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software&#039;s, install new devices, 
download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system.
This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. 
Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.
Clean registry make pc faster.

            <Content>Christ, that is slow.

Go on speedtest.net and test your speed, then contact Bell and see what&#039;s up.

If this is happening frequently, then I would seriously consider changing ISP.</Content>

Lots of things get saved on your PC that you don&#039;t need. Some are benign. Some slow you down. And some let prying eyes track what you do on your PC.
install Registry cleaner and run daily.
