    <Subject>How to get my dad&#039;s DeviantArt more views?</Subject>
    <Content>My dad recently started uploading his photography to DeviantArt. He works really hard at it, and it&#039;s actually good. But nobody&#039;s taking much notice of it, and it&#039;s getting him down. It&#039;s also upsetting me because I want to him do well but I am seeing is his disappointment. :&#039;(
Could there be a way to promote his art without being too pushy or spamming people (I don&#039;t want to annoy people).

This is my dad&#039;s deviantart by the way http://finnanohare.deviantart.com/

            <Content>Yes your dad is quite good.  Has he tried putting his pics on flickr.com?  They have a much bigger audience and he can join groups over there and add his pics to those groups thus getting more visibility.  Just a thought</Content>
