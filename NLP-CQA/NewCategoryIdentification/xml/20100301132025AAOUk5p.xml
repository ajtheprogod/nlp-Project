    <Subject>How can I use a Windows Mobile based mobile phone as a modem?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a HTC Touch mobile phone with Windows Mobile 6.1. I have tried using the Comm manager and switching on Internet Sharing, and turning on the connect option only to have the Windows 7 Home Premium Sony VAIO to not recognize the phone as a modem. Any Ideas? Should I call US Cellular? Sony? Windows? lol yeah right as if they even have a support hotline. lol
I guess I should have added I also have the software..Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1

            <Content>Its possible your carrier has disabled Internet sharing. 

But, you have to ensure that active-sync is installed, because if it isn&#039;t your phone will not connect. Can you dial up without the computer connected? If so then I suspect its been disabled if you&#039;re running the Internet sharing app.</Content>
