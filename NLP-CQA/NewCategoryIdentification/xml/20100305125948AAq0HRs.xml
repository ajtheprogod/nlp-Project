    <ChosenAnswer>I tried the alternatives suggested but you need to fill out surveys that are NOT free since they ask for credit card # or cell phone #.. these are not replacements for icefilms.. they are scams..
I&#039;m still hoping it will come back..</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Last week they were talking about moving to another server, so I&#039;m assuming they&#039;re in the process of doing that.  It looks like according to their Twitter page, they&#039;re moving to http://www.icefilmstube.com.  Apparently the switch is still in process.  Hope this helps.</Content>
