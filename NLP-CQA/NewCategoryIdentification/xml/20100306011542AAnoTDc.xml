    <Content>What is a good free site to publish a few webpages, easy to use, for more info on an Ebay listing I want to do?  I want to provide a link from my auction to list some more pictures for free, instead of paying EBAY to show more pictures, and also to list more info about my auction.

    <ChosenAnswer>If you just want to add more images you can use an image hosting site like imageshack or photobucket - then use HTML to include the images in your auction page on ebay. (imageshack/photobucket will give you the HTML to use)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I am on virgin media. and you are given web space free. but you never see it or hear about it. you need to ask.. so ask your provider first , you may have web space. 

mine is http://homepage.ntlworld.com/david.horton10/default.html  
do it in word 2007 and save as web page. upload with FileZilla  

else use ms messanger webspace and blog it there free just take the address from top and paste in ebay.
yahoo may have profile page and put it there and save the address and paste

hope this helps

or pay Â£10 on www.one.com for a web site and domain name like http://www.thegeniuscircle.com/

this is a site I wrote (web master)</Content>
