            <Content>Add-on&#039;s are programs for your browser. See links below for more info.

Try disabling each one until the problem stops to find out which one is causing it.

Using the Manage Add-ons feature
To change the status of an add-on or to update an add-on, follow these steps: 
Start Internet Explorer. 
On the Tools menu, click Manage Add-ons. 
Click the name of the add-on. 
Use one of the following methods: 
Click Update ActiveX to replace the add-on with the current version. This option is not available for all add-ons. 
To enable an add-on, click Enable, and then click OK. 
To disable an add-on, click Disable, and then click OK. 
You may have to restart Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect after you enable or disable an add-on.</Content>

            <Content>You could install the new Windows Internet Explorer 8 its free and is easy to download and doesn&#039;t take long. This will take the place of your current browser and all the faults. 

You can always re-install the add-ons you want, with no trouble, and be back up and running again. 

Probably what the browser said about it being an add-on at fault could mean a virus attack.
Just get the new current browser and everything will be fine.

PS  Add-ons are only extra features of software for doing special enhancements, of giving you more options.</Content>
