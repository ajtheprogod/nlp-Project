  <Question id="20100306001924AASAFcM" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is a good free e-mail client with few users?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m trying to get an email address with just my name, but my name is too common to get one on the big clients (yahoo, gmail, hotmail, etc). I hate having numbers in my email address, so does anyone know any sites that offer free e-mail, yet have few enough users that I might be able to get a good email address?
