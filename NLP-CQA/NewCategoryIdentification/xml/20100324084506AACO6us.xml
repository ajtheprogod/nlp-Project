    <ChosenAnswer>Smile.jpg or Smile.dog is a very long and winding case of bad Creepypasta. A Weeaboo obviously thought it would be super awesome to create a story that was very similar in content to The Ring, with the same prank infamy of The Grifter. The resulting urban legend is about a college reporter who hears rumours of a picture that makes people kill themselves and causes epilepsy despite being a still image.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Is all just psychological. Whatever you think you&#039;re supposed to do drives you mad. Of course the picture on it self can&#039;t do you any harm.</Content>
