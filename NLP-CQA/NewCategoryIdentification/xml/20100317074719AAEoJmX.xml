    <ChosenAnswer>Only you can decide :)
I&#039;d take the iPod if I were you =D

Also, I&quot;m not really sure when the redemption is... there will some kind of hint on the Lockerz website and I believe they will put a time when the redemption will be.

@Kinghomie: Although the site is still in beta, the prizes run out of stock pretty quick, but I read on their website and they say they will fix this once they&#039;re out of Beta so that everyone can get something. So till then, you&#039;ll have to be pretty fast to get a good prize :D

@John C: Lockerz is not a scam. I have a friend that has got an iMac, an iPod touch 64Gb, and the Z-list t-shirt from them. You can also convince yourself that lockerz is not a scam by searching on youtube with the term &quot;lockerz unboxing&quot;. There are many and maaany results you will find. That way you will see lockerz is not a scam</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Don&#039;t think you will get anything due to lockerz selling out so fast and the prizes are apparently going to be FOUR TIMES what they state on their redeem page!

            <Content>Lockerz is not a scam. My friend got a PS3 from it. It is quite likely you might not get it though due to the busy traffic. Personally I would try for the iPod Touch 8GB, I have an iPod Touch 16gb and it is amazing. Its worth a try.</Content>
