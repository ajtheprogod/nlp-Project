  <Question id="20100320145417AAUcyd6" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I&#039;m looking for help creating my blog (blogspot.com)?</Subject>
    <Content>Alright. I started a blog a couple of days ago, and I&#039;m really excited to get it started. Only problem is... I have no idea what I&#039;m doing.

I&#039;ve done all of the &#039;steps&#039; blogger.com lays out for you (i.e. signing up, naming the blog, picking a template, etc) but... I want mine to look cool, like all of the other ones do.

So how do I go about making or finding a custom template? Please don&#039;t just say &#039;photoshop&#039;, because I don&#039;t know how to use that, either. Does the software come standard on computers, or do I need to download a certain program or something?

I&#039;m also curious about how to make my own banner.

Thank you for your answers... I will definitely pick a best answer.
