    <Subject>can i transfer a domain name after it has been renewed?</Subject>
    <Content>I know after you register a domain name you have to wait 60 days before you can transfer it, but what about transferring after it has been renewed?

I am trying to transfer my domain from a company I am unhappy with.  I told them I wanted to transfer it and asked for them to unlock it and send me the auth code.  Instead they just renewed the registration for another year.  does this mean I have to wait 60 days before I can try to transfer it?
