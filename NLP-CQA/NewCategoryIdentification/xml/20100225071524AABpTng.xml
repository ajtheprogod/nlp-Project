  <Question id="20100225071524AABpTng" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does anyone know what&#039;s up with CompUsa?</Subject>
    <Content>I have been trying to visit the CompUsa website for two days now. It simply won&#039;t load/open. I constantly encounter &quot;The page cannot be displayed&quot;. That only occurs for www.compusa.com. Other sites seem to load normal. Did something go wrong with their site?

            <Content>It sounds like something is up with your DNS possibly.  I am able to get to their site just fine.

Try going to start -&gt; Run -&gt; type cmd and press enter

type ping compusa.com

If your dns is working properly you should receive 4 Replies.  Otherwise you may need to change your dns server settings or contact your ISP.</Content>
