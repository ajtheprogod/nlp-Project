  <Question id="20100327025729AAnaV7n" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What add-on for FireFox =)?</Subject>
    <Content>can let me save every image on a current page? My sister likes to download galleries and galleries of pictures of a certain celebrity, but it lists all the images on one page and she literally has to click on each of the hundred images for it to open in a new tab so she can save it in good quality (if she saves the thumbnails, that&#039;s exactly what gets saved - a thumbnail)

So, is there any add-on that lets you somehow download the full resolution of multiple images without having to open them in new tabs?

Thanks for any help ^^

    <ChosenAnswer>Thumbnails is kinda hard to work with, when all the images are on the page itself I click File-&gt;Save Page As ad save it as Webpage Complete and then beside the saved HTML file there&#039;ll be a folder with all the page&#039;s contents, among them are the images, by arranging them by type you can copy the images to a new folder...

You can also go to the Add-ons page and search for &quot;image download&quot;, I see there&#039;s one called &quot;Bulk Image Downloader&quot; which says that it downloads from thumbnails, but I haven&#039;t tried it myself...</ChosenAnswer>
