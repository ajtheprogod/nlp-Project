        <Answer>
            <Content>Do you share your computer with anyone else? That would be the first question to ask.

If yes find out when the sites are visited by using the history bar, and then find out who was on at that time.

If not then it may just be ad sites that have been popping up on sites you have visited.

Hope that helped.</Content>
