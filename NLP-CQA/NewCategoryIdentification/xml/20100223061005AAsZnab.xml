  <Question id="20100223061005AAsZnab" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Better than Blogger &amp;  Wordpress?</Subject>
    <Content>are there any sites similar to these two, but maybe even better? I&#039;m tired of having a limited choice of links in WordPress and tired of the errors I get in Blogger. I&#039;d love to get a website blog, but don&#039;t have the money for hosting. What sites, until I get a domain and website, can I use as an alternative to the two sites I mentioned?
