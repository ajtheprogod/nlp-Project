    <ChosenAnswer>Well, I&#039;m the same way when it comes to computers. TV? Not so much. I&#039;ve embraced that I just love computers. Working with computers, programming computers, basically (almost) anything and everything computer-related, I love.

If you are still wanting to change your habits. Just find something else to occupy your time. Play games, go outside, talk to friends, etc. Eventually you&#039;ll find that you aren&#039;t spending near as much time on your computer as you were.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Reference>I&#039;m an introvert, so I love computers. (Their something to do when alone) But I&#039;ve been in the same situation.</Reference>
