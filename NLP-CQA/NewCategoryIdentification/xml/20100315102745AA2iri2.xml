    <Subject>Firefox won&#039;t save my settings?</Subject>
    <Content>The default address bar search engine for Firefox is Ask.com. I REALLY prefer Google, so I found out how to change my setting so that when ever I type something the address bar it&#039;ll search it on Google (Ever use Chrome? Just like that, I love that feature.) A few weeks ago I upgraded my Firefox version, and It reverted to Ask.com. I&#039;ve changed it back several times, yet it ALWAYS reverts to Ask within a few minutes. I&#039;ve tried rebooting, doesn&#039;t help.

NOTE: I know FF has a search bar, but I like using the address bar for it. I feels more like chrome, while having the functionality of FF
I do have the latest version.
