        <Answer>
            <Content>no you cant the reason I know is that I was an telecommunications engineer and it is not allowed under the data protections act,  If you know a persons Name and address you can get  their number for the phone directory and that&#039;s all , just try and call directory enquiries and ask for the name and address of a person 
with just a phone number and see what sort of answer you will get they will not give you that information because it would be illegally. so if you have the number then call it and get the address and name that way
but I bet their is a hidden season you will not do that I hope I have explained and helped you with the answer</Content>
