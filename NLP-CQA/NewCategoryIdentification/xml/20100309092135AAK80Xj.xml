  <Question id="20100309092135AAK80Xj" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What does this internet box do/connect to?</Subject>
    <Content>I have broadband internet with Virgin Media and on the wall there is a white box with Ntl&#039;s logo on it. For those who don&#039;t know Virgin Media bought out Ntl years ago so this box is really old. There are two wires coming out of it. A white one which goes into the modem and a black one which goes under the floor boards.

What I&#039;m wondering is.. how does the black wire get the connection? And if I switch internet to a wireless BT connection, will I need this box anymore? Because BT will be giving me a Home Hub (wireless router) and we already have a phone line with BT.... Just trying to get my head around all of this :P

Thanks in advance :)
Just so you know I don&#039;t have a TV service like Cable or Sky.
Just have the Virgin Broadband and BT phone.

    <ChosenAnswer>The one on the wall is cable internet. It gets it&#039;s signal from the same line the TV converter box would use. If you&#039;re getting a different internet service you won&#039;t need to bother with it at all.</ChosenAnswer>
