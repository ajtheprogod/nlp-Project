    <Content>MSN virus?!!!!!!!!!!?
my friend sent me something about a photo about me? and there were a link and i stupidly clicked it and then this pop up saying allow or dont allow this thing, and i clicked allow (stupid of me?) and then my msn went all dodgy so i quickly restarted my laptop and then logged onto msn. then another friend of mine is asking me why i sent her a link and i didn&#039;t even send her a link. and i asked the person who sent me the link why she sent me that, and she said she didnt send me a link and she said that i sent her that link when i sent no links. now my msn is all dodgy. - i can&#039;t open convos with friends, it won&#039;t let me, and random contacts of mine pops up and closes really quick? is there any way to get rid of this virus its bugging me.
