This page is microsoft troubleshooting for internet explorer problems.  Rather than try to guess you might check out these steps.
EDIT-I have read that sometimes simply clearing the cache will solve the problem(delete browsing history.)
 Also be sure your windows updates are on so newer pages are recognized.
 Let us know how you solve it so we can benefit.</ChosenAnswer>
