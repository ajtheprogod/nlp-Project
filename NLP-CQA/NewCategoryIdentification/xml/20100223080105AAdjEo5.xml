EDIT: 
&quot;Spleak was an IM platform where users could publish and rate content. By the time it closed, it had existed in the form of six bots. It is currently not in use, and all of her bots are offline.&quot;
Operative words are: WAS &amp; CLOSED, as in dead &amp; gone. Has been for over a year.

Choose another widget, such as SmarterChild, chatbots.org:  http://www.chatbots.org/directory/feed AIM Bots, or 1 of the 1000&#039;s of others. 
Learn to use The Google or The Bing or The Yahoo. They can be very helpful
