    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s unlikely since those kind of file hosting services earn money and pay you by showing ads. That means that every time someone&#039;s downloading something they see some ads which pay for: their bandwidth, servers, electricity, employees, plus your earnings and their profit.

If everybody posted huge files that would mean that they would show a lot less ads per MB of download which probably wouldn&#039;t be enough to pay for everything.</ChosenAnswer>
