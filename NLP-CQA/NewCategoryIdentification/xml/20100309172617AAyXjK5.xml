    <ChosenAnswer>It sounds like you&#039;re trying to rez the home on land that you don&#039;t own.   Every piece of land in SL is owned by someone and each one has a certain prim count allotment.    Owners are careful about their prim counts and it&#039;s considered extremely rude to rez something on land that you don&#039;t own unless there is a prior agreement with the owner.   Ultimately the land owner has full control over what&#039;s on his land and if he doesn&#039;t own it, he&#039;ll likely return it.

There are public sandboxes that allow you to rez items or build stuff, but only temporarily. You&#039;re expected to de-rez all your stuff when you leave.

If you want a permanent house to live in, then you&#039;ll need to own or rent land.  I&#039;d recommend renting.</ChosenAnswer>
