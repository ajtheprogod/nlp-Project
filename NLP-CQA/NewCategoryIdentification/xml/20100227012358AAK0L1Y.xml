    <ChosenAnswer>That&#039;s a bit of a loaded question isn&#039;t it? 

It entirely depends on your RAM size, CPU speed and your internect connection speed.

It also depends on how much hanging on junk you have on the browser, like Tabs, Feeds, RSS etc.

I run IE 8 with absolutely everything disabled on it so it is just a bare minimum browser that&#039;s connected to a fibre optic 20 Mb/s connection which delivers, so yes I would say that is fast!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Chrome for Windows is considerably faster than Firefox. Chromium for Linux is faster than Chrome. But that&#039;s just my opinion. =) I guess it has a lot to do with your computer, as well.</Content>
