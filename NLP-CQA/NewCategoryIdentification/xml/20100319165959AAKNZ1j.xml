  <Question id="20100319165959AAKNZ1j" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What are good blog ideas?</Subject>
    <Content>I want to start a blog, but I don&#039;t really know what people would be interested in reading about.
I was thinking about doing a weekly blog on American Idol, but there are quite a few of those out there. 
And I don&#039;t really know about doing one about my life because I find that they don&#039;t really interest me unless I know them. 
So what kind of blogs are you interested in reading?

            <Content>Well around two years ago I made a blog about who should win american idol and other users vote by commenting. I got around 200 votes then. I never got to finish it because I didn&#039;t go on American Idol website in a while but now i&#039;m back on. 
My username of American Idol website is: Sillyfrogster
You can go to myidol.americanidol.com/sillyfrogster to check out my blog post to see how I set them up.
Another idea is to make reviews of contestants performance and who got voted off.</Content>
