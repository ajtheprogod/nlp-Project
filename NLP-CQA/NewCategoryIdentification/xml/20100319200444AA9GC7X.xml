    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s true what they say.  The game is not available as of right now.  I have heard from their community website that the game will become available on April 4th.  I check everyday just to make sure the game isn&#039;t there yet.  I have already about 8 new Bakugans with 8 different codes that I also want to enter on the game.  I can&#039;t hardly wait!!!</ChosenAnswer>
