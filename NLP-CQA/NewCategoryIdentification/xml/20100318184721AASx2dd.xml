    <ChosenAnswer>If your website is interactive and had lot of readers then sure many people will follow you on twitter. Well basically i dont believe that many people would be attracted from a website. For getting loads of people to follow you tweet one daily with interactive comments. Follow peoples which are related to your topic on http://twitterfall.com/ very helpful site.</ChosenAnswer>
