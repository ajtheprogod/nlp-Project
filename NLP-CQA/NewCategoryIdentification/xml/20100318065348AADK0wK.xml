    <Subject>How do some webmasters embed Yahoo answers of their websites?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve noticed a number of websites that have embedded Yahoo Answers on their pages - obviously an easy way to add content - but I see nothing in the Yahoo site that offers embedded links such as the ones on YouTube - is html available?.
