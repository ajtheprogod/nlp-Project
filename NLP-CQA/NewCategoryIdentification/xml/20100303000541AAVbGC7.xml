  <Question id="20100303000541AAVbGC7" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why isn&#039;t my purchases on Itunes coming off my gift card balance?</Subject>
    <Content>Today, I redeemed my $20.00 gift card and purchased a $4.00 application for my Ipod Touch.
But it still says $20.00 on my gift card balance. 
Does it take a while to update? 
Or has this purchase been charged to my credit card?
Should I contact Itunes?
They said that they deduct gift card balances first, then do credit card.
Does it make a difference, that I redemeed it on my computer, but purchased it on my Ipod?
Thanks!
I live in Australia, so I assume the gift card is Australian.

    <ChosenAnswer>Not sure if you live in Canada but Itunes giftcards do not work for apps whatsoever in Canada. If you purchase an app with a Canadian gift card already credited to you account, Itunes automatically withdraws it from whatever payment form you have attached.</ChosenAnswer>
