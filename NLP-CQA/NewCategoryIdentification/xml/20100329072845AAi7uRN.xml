    <ChosenAnswer>Most people check their auctions on the weekends, so I would actually have most of my auctions ending either Saturday morning or Sunday night. Also, avoid having them end during the week during the day. It&#039;s hard to snipe an auction if you can&#039;t keep tabs on it. And as a seller, you want to have snipers for your auction. I would suggest weekday nights (preferably Friday or Thursday), or Saturday during the day. Sundays you have to fight church and sports, and aren&#039;t assured of bidders.</ChosenAnswer>
