    <ChosenAnswer>There are some Twitter Tools that may help you.

TweetLater essentially allows you to automate some of the processes and building relationships with twitter. You can not only send follow-up messages at scheduled times using twitter, but you can instantly send a welcome message, not a spam message, to all of your new followers.

Plus, you can automatically follow every one that follows you. I would highly suggest doing this. Because following everyone that follows you shows respect. Plus, it allows you to build relationships that much easier.

TweetDeck is a tool that allows you to manage your twitter account with ease. You can easily follow the conversations between a time of different twitter users using TweetDeck. This application is a desktop application that will allow you to easily follow all of your tweets, all of your replies and all of your direct messages.

TweetDeck alliances these different categories into different columns so they are easily viewable and readable.</ChosenAnswer>
