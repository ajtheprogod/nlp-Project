            <Reference>I am a programmer myself (a really pathetic one but still i make games by my own), so I know whats the risk of making the employee code... How to unhack a computer?? Hackers have programs that spin around all the numbers and get the code... That means if there was a employee code, i would be found already... ;)</Reference>
