    <Subject>How can I get a refund from a recovery password resetter?</Subject>
    <Content>I purchased a software, Windows Password Recovery Tool, but I don&#039;t need it anymore. I emailed them 4 times already saying that I want a refund but they keep saying &quot;Tell us more about your problem, that way we can help you further.&quot; And I keep telling them I want a refund, but they keep saying the same thing. It said it on the website that there was a 30-day money back guarantee. Is there anything I can do but to keep emailing them? Thanks.......
I&#039;ve never used it though, and plus, before I couldn&#039;t even use since I forgot my administrator&#039;s password, and to download something I need the administrators password. I deleted everything and started all over, so I don&#039;t need it anymore.

    <ChosenAnswer>&quot;Money back guarantee&quot; means if it doesn&#039;t work.  It worked.  You got what you paid for.  It&#039;s now yours.

            <Content>Once you&#039;ve used the product, it belongs to you unless it&#039;s defective for some reason. The 30 day money back guarantee is for when the product doesn&#039;t work as stated. If you used it and found the password, then it worked for you. You&#039;ll have to prove to them that it will not work on your system to do what they claim it will do. Good luck!</Content>
            <Reference>Just my opinion.</Reference>
