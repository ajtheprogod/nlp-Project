    <ChosenAnswer>IE is the most used and the best, being as its written for windows. FireFox closely follows. I have never had a problem with then new IE8, (or IE7 for that matter.) I would say safari is the worst browser out there, for the simple reason of it was written by a company who don&#039;t understand windows, and leave a dozen security holes in there own OS, so why wouldn&#039;t they with there Internet browser. 

If you&#039;re after the fastest, chromes meant to be that, but I&#039;ve always found IE adequte enough for my needs.</ChosenAnswer>
