    <ChosenAnswer>Hi Ryan,

It appears your attempting to outsource your content creation (yes, I have a grasp of the obvious) using barter. Exchange a link for content.

Smart, however, hard to get any takers since content creation takes effort.

I automate this with the use of a WP plugin.

I know a guy who&#039;s used it to garner a #3 position in the Google SERP for his keyword.

Granted, it takes much more than simply filling a blog to get #1 page ranking, but it certainly helps.</ChosenAnswer>
