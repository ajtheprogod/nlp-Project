  <Question id="20100324123921AASy9xc" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Can you specify what type of movies you want suggested to you on netflix?</Subject>
    <Content>I gave the True Blood Series of DVDs a five star rating several months ago, now most of my &quot;movies you&#039;ll love&quot; suggestions are tv series! I depend on suggestions alot to decide what I want to rent, but I do not want to rent tons of tv episodes, I want movies.

Is there a way to tell netflix to not suggest tv series to me anymore?
