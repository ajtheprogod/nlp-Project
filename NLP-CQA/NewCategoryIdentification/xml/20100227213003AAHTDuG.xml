            <Content>If you want a free macbook then join lockerz. Lockerz is a site were you get many things for free but you don&#039;t have to do any offers or surveys. You have to get points. There is many ways to get points including logging in, watching videos, playing games, listening to music and more. There is three different types you can get
macbook
macbook pro aluminum
macbook air

You can also get more than just a macbook like
ps3
xbox 360
pspgo
nintendo wii

The only thing is you have to be invited. Lockerz is an invite site only. But if you want an invite then email me at betanch@gmail.com and I will send you an invite between 1 min and a week. Usually I check my email every day so I won&#039;t miss your email.</Content>
