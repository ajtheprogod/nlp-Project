    <ChosenAnswer>Demonoid is now open to the public for registrations so be quick.
If you&#039;re lucky enough to get in then you&#039;ll have to look out for an activation email that will be from gate_keeper and NOT Demonoid.
This can sometimes end up in your Spam folder so be sure to check there if you don&#039;t see it.
Please try and give back at least as much as you take so anything above 1.1 is always appreciated.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You&#039;ll need to get invited. Google a bit for Demonoid invites or just search on YouTube. They often give away invites really fast</Content>
