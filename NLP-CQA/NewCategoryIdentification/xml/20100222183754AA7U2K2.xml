    <Subject>Where can I find these pictures of the Copeman Toaster?</Subject>
    <Content>What was the website address? It was a sepia toned picture of a window display of the Copeman Toasters. There were other pictures with the same colors; one contained a picture of the toaster with the message It Turns the Toast below the picture, another was  4-step diagram of how the toaster turned the toast.
