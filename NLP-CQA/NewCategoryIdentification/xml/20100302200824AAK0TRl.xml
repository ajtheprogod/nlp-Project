    <ChosenAnswer>You need to file a non payment dispute first &amp; close it before you give any underbidders the SCO. This is so you will receive your final valuation fees back from ebay, you give the bidder a strike for non payment &amp; also you could find yourself in the position of having two buyers for one item meaning the winning bidder could pay you after the SCO has been accepted by the underbidder. (it does happen) So its best to follow ebays &quot;proper procedure&quot; if you know what I mean.

However as already stated, the buyer has 7 days to pay &amp; some buyers take that long without contacting you! If it comes to day 7 &amp; you havent received payment, send them a reminder. Then if they dont respond/pay up in a reasonable timeframe, open the dispute.

Also dont close the dispute on a promise of payment wait until you actually have the funds in your paypal/bank account because disputes cant be reopened

Dont panic yet though, its early days :)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Hi,
The buyer has 7 days to pay, therefore you can&#039;t offer the item until at least day 8. Some buyers aren&#039;t that quick to pay, did you send them an ebay invoice with bid + shipping cost? You&#039;ll find most will pay in a quick manner, patience is important on ebay. If you send too many reminders then the buyer gets annoyed &amp; that will reflect when it comes to feedback &amp; DSR ratings. Usually i invoice the buyer &amp; send an email directly thanking them for their bid etc. If no payment by day 5 i send a reminder that if they don&#039;t want the item i may offer it to the next bidder, that gets them to pay. When you ship make sure you add delivery confirmation as proof of delivery. BTW.. online usps postage costs less than post office.</Content>
