    <ChosenAnswer>doubtful. your &quot;cookies&quot; were probably deleted. those are files that save information like passwords. but no worry, its healthy for the computer for those to be deleted every once in a while.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>All of this information is stored in something called a cookie. This little file contains the information to each website and can be deleted by going to tools -&gt; internet options in internet explorer. If these cookies are deleted,  the next time you visit the site you will need to log in again. There shouldn&#039;t be any worries for viruses or malware. If you suspect anything, use your anti virus program such as McAfee or Symantec and then use an anti-malware program such as Ad-aware or Malwarebytes Anti-malware to be safe.</Content>

            <Content>You likely just deleted your history and this may have &quot;cleaned out&quot; your cookies, passwords etc. from the browser. That&#039;s not a problem, and should be done regularly anyway. Just re-enter the information and uncheck any boxes that delete your &quot;browsing history&quot; information. It doesn&#039;t sound like any virus. Good luck!</Content>
