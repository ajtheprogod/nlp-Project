            <Content>Ok then crash lesson in e safty and keeping for details safe. never do these freebie site they are mostly fishing sites and steal info from you and your computer also though if you are getting anything free online then check the site on weboftrust.com and read the reviews and safty rating. I never give out any info for anything which claims some thing is free.</Content>

            <Content>Hi,
For me worked fine. I got 2 gift cards, one from Ikea and one from Walmart.
I found it here www.get-free-gift-cards.com/.
How to really get the card free:
After email submission they will send you some offers to complete or free trials to different products.
Pay with your credit card for a free trial. After 2 weeks cancel the free trial so your credit card won&#039;t be charged.
So that&#039;s how I got 2000$ gift cards. 
The secret is to complete free trials so they will think you will buy more and more products. They will send you the gift card for Walmart or Ikea...etc.
When your gift card arrives don&#039;t forget to cancel the free trials.
Conclusion: Your credit card will never be charged and you will have 1000$ to spend in your favorite store.</Content>
