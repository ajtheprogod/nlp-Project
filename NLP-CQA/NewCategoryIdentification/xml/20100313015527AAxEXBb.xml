    <Answers>
        <Answer>
            <Content>Depends on what you are tweeting for...

Are you trying to increase your online exposure?
Are you trying to use Twitter as a promotion platform for a business?
or
Are you just tweeting similar to the way you SMS?

If it&#039;s like an SMS then like me you may not find it of any use to you.

If it for any of the other reasons then you might like to consider starting again and also check out the information I have on TopRanked Website.com.au see reference link below.</Content>
