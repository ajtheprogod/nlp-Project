    <ChosenAnswer>Hey B,

I lean toward Wordpress.com simply for the ease and simplicity.

There&#039;s also Blogger.com. Not one of my favorites because it&#039;s owned by Google and they have a history of locking people out of their own blogs.

Now, in fairness I nave to say they do this because of an appearance of violation of the terms of service.
That said, they don&#039;t warn you and ask for an explanation. They just lock you out without warning and wait for you to find them.

So, as a newby I recommend Wordpress.com</ChosenAnswer>
