    <ChosenAnswer>Someone mentioned downforev... But that&#039;s a heck of a lot to type each time you want to see if a website is down.

The short version is http://checkw.com/

In this particular case, use the link http://checkw.com/www.chatroulette.com or go to the main page and type in www.chatroulette.com

CheckW says its online now, and I can see it is up myself, so it is accurate.

Good luck ;)</ChosenAnswer>

I have no idea why; I just found out about it and tried to see what this is. Is it down frequently?</Content>
