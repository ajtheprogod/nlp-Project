    <ChosenAnswer>First of all, in order to log out correctly make sure your keyboard is plugged in to the front usb spot of your computer instead of the back. Secondly, make sure to hit the log out button three times consecutively before the window changes. Then if this still does not work, it always helps to fight the computer.</ChosenAnswer>
