    <Subject>Why does microsoft internet explorer window keep popping up?</Subject>
    <Content>It&#039;s my dads laptop. It is a windows xp I believe. It doesn&#039;t have a link it&#039;s one of those &quot;help&quot; pages I would say, the icon to the left of the title has a paper and a yellow question mark to the right of it and next to it, it reads &quot;Microsoft Internet Explorer&quot; and inside the screen would say &quot;Setting up an Internet connection&quot; I do not understand because the internet connection is set up. I have no clue what to do please help, I&#039;m not to savy with computers.

    <ChosenAnswer>I can only suggest using a different browser. What is popping up may be Malware on the computer. I have never seen this kind of message, so I have no answer.</ChosenAnswer>
