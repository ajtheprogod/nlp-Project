    <Content>...try to watch any video online (eg youtube).  Extremely annoyed after following instructions to Uninstal/reinstall the flash player, resetting internet options etc.  Details on what happens below. Just wanting to know if anyone else has had this same problem and what you did to fix it.  thanks a ton!

While waiting for  the video to begin its upload process a large black window appears (the player) a small cluster of circles appear in the middle and rotate for about 20 seconds. then a complete freeze.  When trying to exit the page or reset, the page turns a cloudy white and im forced to shut down.  again, thanks for your help.

            <Content>Please copy the links and paste them in your web browser. I think your flash player is not properly installed or not working properly. To watch videos on youtube you also need Java Runtime so you should try both the links.

            <Content>The Windows operating system constantly refers to the registry to get information about all of the components such as hardware and software which are installed on the computer. The registry tells Windows what to do and how to access the various programs, files, and processes.However, the registry can contain bad information which sends Windows off doing useless tasks or running unneeded routines. Sometimes errors occur including the freezeing. Other times the system slows down. Because of the sheer number of factors that can affect the registry, there’s no one size fits all approach. You can’t just go into the registry and remove the bad information because it’s nearly impossible to decipher which information is good and which information is bad. That’s a job better suited for software. I should like to commend Registry Easy http://computer-e-book-money.com            to you ! You can try ! Good luck!</Content>
