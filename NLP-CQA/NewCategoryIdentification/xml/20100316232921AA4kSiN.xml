    <ChosenAnswer>Absolutely nothing, I&#039;m in the exact same situation. Except I disagree about satellite internet, it absolutely sucks. We hit our bandwidth limit every single month.

Just keep pestering the DSL company until they decide to extend the lines.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Well, if it&#039;s not available in your area...you could move? That is the only way really. Satellite is fine for the most part, unless you have the lower grade ones, which can have up to 2 seconds of delay.</Content>

            <Content>OK first of all, Jay-R is completely wrong. DSL is not faster then Cable. the best technology for internet is cable THEN dsl, then satellite and lastly dial up. With DSL you have to put filters on each house phone you have in the house to not interfere with lAN line phone calls. Cable does not need anything extra, the reason I know is because I did technical support for Comcast and AT&amp;T DSL. As far as you wanting DSL your pretty much stuck like chuck so the best way would be to move in an area that offers it or pay the Cable or DSL company to run the fiber optics to your house which WILL range in the thousands depending how far you are from the end of the DSL or Cable line.</Content>
