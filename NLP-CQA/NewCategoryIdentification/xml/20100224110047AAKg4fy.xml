    <ChosenAnswer>If less then a week has past be patient.  Ideally the buyer should have given you a tracking number and notified that he shipped the item to you.  If neither of those have happened and a week or more has passed email the seller and ask him where the item is.  If he doesn&#039;t respond back file a claim on Paypal or Ebay.</ChosenAnswer>
