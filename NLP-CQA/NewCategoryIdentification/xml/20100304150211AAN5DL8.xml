  <Question id="20100304150211AAN5DL8" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why can&#039;t I play video?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay, I switched computers to my dad&#039;s Windows Vista. Everything has been working great but I immediately noticed that a lot of videos aren&#039;t working. Only internet videos, like none of the &quot;play video here&quot; on google  videos work (but when I click on the link, it works on the home site) and ALL the different players on different sites. Youtube works but that is about it. When I try to use the video, no matter what site it is, it very often has a small picture in the top left that look like a bunch of colours. I&#039;ve never had this happen before, I do have Explorer 8. I think it might be because it has to be on the original site. Please Help.

    <ChosenAnswer>Adobe Flash is required to play on most of those.  It is available at http://adobe.com

You might also need Java:  http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp

For non-Internet based videos (like downloaded movies) you&#039;ll want to install the K-Lite codec pack:  http://www.free-codecs.com/K_lite_codec_pack_download.htm

These are all free.

If none of this works you can always reset Internet Explorer 8.  This will remove all of the add-ons (toolbars and stuff) that might be getting in the way, and take it back to factory settings.  You&#039;ll still have your favorites, but you&#039;ll have to reinstall things like Flash Player or any toolbars.

To reset Internet Explorer 8, click Tools, Internet Options, Advanced.  Try the &quot;restore&quot; option first.  If that doesn&#039;t let you see the videos go back and try the &quot;reset&quot; option.

It *will* work if you do a reset, then install Flash Player.</ChosenAnswer>
