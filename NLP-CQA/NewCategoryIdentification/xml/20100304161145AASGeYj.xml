    <ChosenAnswer>Hey guys

There&#039;s this new startup company in Palo Alto that was started by people who were sick of the way eBay ripped off their sellers. It&#039;s a quick and easy way to sell things and market the things you&#039;re selling.

It connects to your social networking websites and shows all your friends what is being sold. The listing is also posted on the website&#039;s twitter and marketed all over the web

Check out the site: http://yardsellr.com/C0Y

It&#039;s called &quot;yardsellr&quot;

Hope you guys like it. Email me anything you have to say about the site: questions, comments, feedback, anything at maryminno@yahoo.com. If you like the site, share it with your friends.

            <Content>There are plenty of other auction websites but they are not really better. What I would recommend is looking for local furniture auction places. I live in Arizona and I know of a furniture auction place about 20 miles from me that buys art/furniture and then resells it at their art/furniture oriented auction. I&#039;m not sure about other states, but this can&#039;t be the only one.</Content>
