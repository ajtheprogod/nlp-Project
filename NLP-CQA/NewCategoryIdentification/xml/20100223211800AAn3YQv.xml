i dont think so pal, the stock market doesnt run on a computer...but many

it would take tons of planning and infiltration would need to happen well before the money was stolen. tons of spying for information would need to be done, and eventually after cracking the TLS protocols they use when doing transactions, you inject your own crafted packet that contains the address of your own bank account, but you don&#039;t steal all the money, just pennies at a time, so no one notices.

eventually after stealing 1000000000 pennies, you&#039;re rich

btw no &#039;virus&#039; could ever accomplish anything near this alone, it takes a hacker at his keyboard, not a script kiddie on hackforums.com</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yes. It can be done. My friend did it once. He wrote some crazy ass virus with Visual Basic and encoder. He was also working with some hackers from Russia. Last year they hacked into NASDAQ and stole a little over $20 million. Nobody found out. My friend&#039;s retired now and he lives on a private island in the Caribbean. We play Halo together sometimes.</Content>
