    <ChosenAnswer>For me the differences are too little to worry about.  My preference has been Firefox for years!  I have a Mac and a PC, I got used to Safari on the Mac and when Safari 4 came out I added it to my PC.  I like Safari.  They claim to be the fastest but I prefer FF for work and Safari for research and storing data.

I like IE least of all but it is much better today than 4 or 5 years ago!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Google Chrome is the fastest browser of the three you have listed, and will most certainly not slow your laptop down. :)</Content>

            <Content>Chrome is probably fastest, but not everyone likes it.

Firefox is the second most popular, quite quick and secure, with loads of useful plug-ins that enable you to customise it to you heart&#039;s content.

IE might be the most used browser, but that&#039;s a majority that doesn&#039;t know that it is probably the least secure and standards compliant [1].

It&#039;s also worth considering Opera [2]. One of the people on the tech mailing list I&#039;m on that uses it describes it as Firefox with all the plug-in versatility as standard. I suspect I&#039;m just being lazy still using Firefox because it&#039;s what comes as standard with my Ubuntu [3] install.

PS. Most browsers are available for most operating systems, but you might get better answers if you specify.</Content>
