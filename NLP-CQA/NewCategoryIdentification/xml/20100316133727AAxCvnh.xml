  <Question id="20100316133727AAxCvnh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Ebay Question... Help me out?</Subject>
    <Content>If you are every bored and play on Ebay like me... you should notice this...

Can ANYONE explain to me why people bid MORE than the value of the gift card up for bid?

Example... I just saw a $500 Wal Mart dollar gift card sell for $505.82 and another $25.00 gift card sell for $25.76.

Is there something I am missing out on?

    <ChosenAnswer>Sometime the owner of the gift cards  have different account in ebay and if they see that the product  they have is not selling to  they price they want they just put there own price so that anybody buy the card.
Usually these people have a not trustful account.
