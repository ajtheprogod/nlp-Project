    <ChosenAnswer>Dear person who answered before me,
Who doesn&#039;t know who Frank Warren is?

To answer your question, I heard that his email is frank@docdel.com
I think you can also post threads on the post secret community board, but as far as his email, I think it is the one I just said. 
Hope this helps!</ChosenAnswer>
