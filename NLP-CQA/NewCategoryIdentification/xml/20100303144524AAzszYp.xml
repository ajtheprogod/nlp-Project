    <ChosenAnswer>As someone who is / used to be involved with creating websites I am always happy to see new people take it up. I know you said don&#039;t say anything negative but I feel constructive criticism is always a good thing.

Personally I have a wide screen monitor. One of the important things on the Internet is to take into account other peoples browser configurations. Due to the fact that you have a fixed width and left justified content I see a column of text down the left side and a giant blank area on the right. To fix this use can use the CSS % instead of specifying pixels. That way on larger screens they will be wider and on smaller screens more narrow.

Another important thing is spelling. The first one I caught was on your computer repair page. &quot;a Virius mite be eating your computer&quot; Virus is spelled incorrectly and it should be &#039;might&#039; and not &#039;mite&#039;. 

Also users might find it difficult to navigate your website due to all the links in the left hand navigation bar. In the sources I have included a link to a nice menu system that collapses down and then perhaps you could put your links and parts of your site into categories.

Hope this helps and your websites grows!</ChosenAnswer>
