    <ChosenAnswer>Does your TV support networking? If it doesn&#039;t have a built-in Ethernet port or wireless capabilities, that&#039;s a definite no. That USB port is not like a computer&#039;s USB port. It is used with a special tool only to service the TV. If you have one of those brand new TVs that supports internet services (which isn&#039;t web browsing), it will have some way of establishing a network connection.

Plus, do you expect special browsing software to magically appear on your TV? You can&#039;t somehow plug in a networking adapter to a television and expect it to &quot;get internet.&quot;</ChosenAnswer>
