    <ChosenAnswer>You can just send a mail to the admins/mods asking them to delete your account.

I do not think they would delete your account totally. They may just remove your login credentials. It&#039;s because no one wants their members to be reduced even though the members do not access the account.

If you wish you can send an invite to me to check ogrish. I would like an account there.</ChosenAnswer>
