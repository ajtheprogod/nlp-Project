  <Question id="20100302195600AAVc4De" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I&#039;ve never used Ebay before, and have a question...?</Subject>
    <Content>I know that you can bid on items there, but how does it work if the item says &quot;buy now&quot;  Does that mean that you buy it like you would on any other site?

Sorry if this sounds stupid, but I&#039;m confused

    <ChosenAnswer>Items listed as &quot;Buy It Now&quot; are available for sale without going through the auction process. You often end up paying a little more, but you don&#039;t have to wait for an auction to finish and take a chance that someone else will get the item.  Yes, the Buy It Now items are available for purchase just like on any other site.  I do that when I&#039;m in a hurry and don&#039;t want to wait 5 days for an auction to end.

            <Content>Yes. It means you skip the bidding and buy it right away. THe only difference with buying from ebay and some other site, is that you cannot always guarantee the quality of the item.</Content>
