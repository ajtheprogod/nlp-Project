    <Subject>Is it ok for neighbor to use my wirelwess Internet connection?</Subject>
    <Content>I live at the beach.  My neighbor&#039;s sister has come down to stay in their condo for March.  They don&#039;t have the Internet and the sister asked if she could use my wireless connection.  I have no problem with her doing this, but I am wondering if she could get my personal information from sharing? How would I block her?

            <Content>They can but thats only if the wanted to hack your router signal, if you trust them and they just want to use the internet for email and whatever I wouldnt worry and since you live at the beach away from people you wouldnt have to worry about anyone outside of the house (strangers) getting into your connection.</Content>
