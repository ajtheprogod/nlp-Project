You can set it with your cap. It will show a running display of your usage [all up and downloads] and keep running logs on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. It will also, work out daily what you have left for the rest of the month and how much you can use each day. It will also warn you when you are approaching that limit.

It will also give some idea how fast your using your limit.

            <Content>it is impossible to calculate the time allowed based on quantity of data. You could use 30Gb in a month or one day. It depends on how much you download/upload (unless your plan doesn&#039;t count uploads). Usually what uses up most data is large video and music files, downoading large size files and attachments, some online gaming, etc...It is best to check your usage on your ISP internet account and move up to higher plan if 30Gb is insuffcient.</Content>
