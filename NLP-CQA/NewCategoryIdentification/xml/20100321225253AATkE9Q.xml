    <ChosenAnswer>No, they don&#039;t. Only if you decide to either invite them to read your blog or they look up your details themselves to find your blog accounts under that email (but that&#039;s largely uncommon unless you have stalker friends) they will not be sent any notification of any new blogs you create.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Reference>From experience and general knowledge - friend created a blog and I didn&#039;t know until she invited me to be an author (I don&#039;t regularly check if my friends make new blogs or not)</Reference>
