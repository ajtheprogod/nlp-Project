    <ChosenAnswer>Sounds like a blip in the website or on your internet browser. Its working fine for me now. Check your settings?

Just in case:
www.royalmail.com/fee2pay
should automatically redirect to:
http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/content2?catId=400046&amp;mediaId=37000674&amp;campaignid=fee2pay_redirect
and then there&#039;s the &quot;pay your fee now&quot; button.


By the way, if its an option, and online payment is proving hard, you can go down to the local sorting office, pay there and pick up the item, if you have the card and ID.
Also, you can stick stamps that match the value of the customs charge onto the card, and then put that in a postbox for them to redeliver.</ChosenAnswer>
