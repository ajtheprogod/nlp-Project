    <ChosenAnswer>They only give away new stuff.

And just so you know, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a scam just because they don&#039;t ask you for any information when you sign up except for your name, birthday and zip code. You can also put in your address later so if you get something with your points they can send it to you. A scammer couldn&#039;t do much with that little amount of info.

You can actually watch videos of people on Youtube unboxing stuff they&#039;ve gotten from there, including a Wii, Xbox 360, PSP, PS3, and one guy even got an 21.5&quot; iMac.

            <Reference>Youtube and lots of digging on the internet. Lots of people all over think it&#039;s a scam but they&#039;ve not got much proof of that. Just look it up a little on Yahoo or Google.</Reference>
