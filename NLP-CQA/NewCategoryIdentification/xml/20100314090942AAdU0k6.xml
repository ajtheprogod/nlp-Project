    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s relatively easy to create an e-mail account with AOL, but unfortunately not quite as easy to close. AOL offers e-mail addresses to those with paid AOL accounts, as well as to those who create AOL Instant Messenger screen names. No deactivation link is provided for users of either of these services, which means a cancellation requires a phone call,hope this helps</ChosenAnswer>
