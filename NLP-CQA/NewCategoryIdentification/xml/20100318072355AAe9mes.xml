    <ChosenAnswer>Hey Adam,

From reading your post, it sounds like you’re on an ADSL service as you’ve also mentioned filters. 

There are a few factors that can impact the speeds you get on this service such as how far you are from the closest telephone exchange, faulty filters and the condition of the copper lines.

If you want to send through your details via our online form http://bit.ly/OPTUS we can have a look at this and run through a few things that may help you out.

Cheers,
