    <ChosenAnswer>Twitter is an website used by millions of people and as referred above by many celebrities. You have a box questioning &quot;What is Happening?&quot;. People answer, sharing their thoughts, views and personal experiences. You can&#039;t write more than 140 characters at a time though. It is a good way to express yourself and see what everyone else is up to. It is not, however, like Facebook or Orkut, more like a microblog where you share whatever you feel like sharing to the world. If people enjoy what you share they&#039;ll &quot;follow&quot; you, this means your messages will appear on their board. You can &quot;follow&quot; many news websites, bands, celebrities,....</ChosenAnswer>
