  <Question id="20100327195612AATdbg4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Will I get credit for creating it and uploading it?</Subject>
    <Content>I made a few psp themes and I know people can upload them on psp-themes.net  but will we be credited for it?  Such as like who created it  and stuff?  I don&#039;t want someone else claiming my work.  Oh and if you know somewhere else where I can upload my psp themes and get credited for it then let me know. Thanks.
