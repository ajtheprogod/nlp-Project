            <Content>It would have been better if you have given your blog url as well. But going by your question and the details, i saw some issues regarding your approach to blogging. 

here are they:

1) Blogging for traffic is all about creating interesting,useful and unique content. A mere match between what you blog about and what people like reading, starts bringing traffic to a blog.So just focus on what you want to say, say that with conviction. Write for yourself, in all probability, it&#039;ll be useful, unique and interesting.

2) To succeed in blogging and reach the highest ranks, is like succeeding in any other profession. one needs conviction in one&#039;s talent/passion (talent/passion should be the category one blog&#039;s about) to succeed. So don&#039;t bother about big names, they were also novice at the beginning.

3) Blogging is all about study and keen observation. 

To promote your blog-- adopt the same approach which one adopts in his or her real life.In blogging context, this is, a) Search for information related to your own blogging category; b) show keen and genuine interest in other people&#039;s blog a) leave useful comments d) extend helping hand d) Don&#039;t hide information, be keen to share e) Keep learning.

Hope you find my answer useful.
