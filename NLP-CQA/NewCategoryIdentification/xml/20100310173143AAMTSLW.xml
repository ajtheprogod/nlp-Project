First place to check is your HOSTS file:
Notepad &gt; Open &gt; %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\drivers\etc

The only entry should be the one with &#039;localhost&#039; (unless you have SpyBot, which also adds &#039;immunization&#039; entries here).

If you can download and run SpyBot, it can help clean up other bad Internet settings:
