  <Question id="20100305121934AAwsX18" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I want to pass some time, does anyone know any good websites to go on to do so?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve run out of ideas on what to do, nothing is happening on facebook etc. I dont mind game sites, but they bore me after a while.. I quite like online games where people from around the world play on. But I dont mind anything which is quite cool and interesting which will grip me for a few hours. :)
