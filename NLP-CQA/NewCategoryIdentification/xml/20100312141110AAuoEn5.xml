    <Subject>How do i use Hotbar to access sites?</Subject>
    <Content>I was searching to watch Sortilegio(love spell) online and i came across www.sotrilegiotv.com. However to watch the episodes for free, i was instructed to download the adware Hotbar ,which promises free access to this site.  I managed to download Hotbar, its functioning pretty well but i still cant get access to the above site. Where am a going wrong?
