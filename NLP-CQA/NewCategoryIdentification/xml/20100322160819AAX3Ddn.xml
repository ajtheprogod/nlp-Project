  <Question id="20100322160819AAX3Ddn" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Removed &quot;vista security virus&quot; but IE and Firefox won&#039;t work!?</Subject>
    <Content>I used Malwarebytes as it is recommended by a lot of people. It didn&#039;t complete the job, so I used Superantispyware as well. That seems to have done the job as the crazy pop ups and warnings are gone.

But now as I try to use my computer(after restarting and everything) Internet Explorer, Firefox, Skype etc. simply don&#039;t work. When I click to start those, it gives me the &quot;open with&quot; window every time. Only if I right click and select &quot;Run as an administrator&quot;, it opens up like it should.

But it is not normal. I shouldn&#039;t have to do it every time! Is the virus still there then?

Please advise.

Thanks guys for your help. That&#039;s what I wanted to do right away but thought there might be a way around it that I don&#039;t know.

The challenge I have is the windows CD, I lost it. I have the serial number etc., but my research showed that I cannot reinstall without the CD. Will contact the manufacturer&#039;s office first thing tomorrow morning. Don&#039;t know if I will get any positives.

Appreciate your help guys.
