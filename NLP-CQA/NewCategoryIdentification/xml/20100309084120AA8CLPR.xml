  <Question id="20100309084120AA8CLPR" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Where can I post my negative opinions of a person or business...?</Subject>
    <Content>to get the most exposure?

I have had the misfortune of being taken by a &quot;realtor&quot; who is involved in illegal activities, fraud etc...I want to find as many online forums to post his picture, list of aliases and company names so that others will know to avoid him (&amp; teach that pompous jerk a lesson).  I will not be posting anything that is untrue or things that I do not have documented proof of so I&#039;m just looking for sites where I can list this information to be viewed by as many people as possible.

Any suggestions or links to sites would be great, thanks!
*an example site would be: filthyliars.com

    <ChosenAnswer>You can search for &quot;reviews&quot; + &quot;realtors&quot; and check out the sites that carry reviews of realtors. You can post your review of the realtor that you had a bad experience with.

Make sure you don&#039;t post things that you cannot substantiate as he/they may file a suit against you.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Assuming they are actually a business, I find the best starting place is the Better Business Bureau. Assuming you have valid claims against the business (which it sounds like you do) you can send it to the BBB. Typically they try to resolve any issues with the business but if you&#039;ve had serious problems with them, then serious measures might be taken.</Content>
