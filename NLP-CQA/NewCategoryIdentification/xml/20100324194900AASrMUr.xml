    <Subject>E-bay question regarding a potential buyer that has no history?</Subject>
    <Content>This guy is really interested in the cell phone that i am selling, the thing is that he has no records of buying anything before. I heard of scamers where they buy something and pay you but when you send the product to them, they somehow take out the money again. is that true?
