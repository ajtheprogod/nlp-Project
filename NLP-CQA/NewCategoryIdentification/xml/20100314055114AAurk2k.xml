  <Question id="20100314055114AAurk2k" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why Can&#039;t I Go On My Twitter?</Subject>
    <Content>When I go to my Twitter account today it said: &#039;Do you want to view only the webpage content that is secure&#039; or something like that and whether I choose yes or no it will always close the window and say that &#039;Internet cannot display the webpage&#039;.

What&#039;s going on?!

    <ChosenAnswer>I do believe Twitter is down.  Probs something to do with the Daylight Savings Time, or the Beiber fans broke it.

Edit:  They have a status report up that they are aware of frozen timelines and are fixing it.  I can get on from my Blackberry but not from my laptop.  Weird.</ChosenAnswer>
