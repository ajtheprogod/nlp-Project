    <Subject>How to do an eBay search by distance only ?</Subject>
    <Content>I am trying to do an Ebay search for any item near me. 
It takes a long time to look at each category for items 
in a small zip range. I know eBay does not like wild card 
searches, but I am just looking for a good deal. I don&#039;t care
what it is only where it is.

    <ChosenAnswer>That&#039;s a hard one for me. I went tp the main eBay page, and clicked on advanced search. It took me to the page where you can search just about any way you want. I picked a category (DVD), and told it to only search within 100 miles of my zip code.

It pulled up searches that were nowhere near where I live. You can always ask on Live Help, with this link. They should be able to help you better than I can:

That&#039;s honestly the most help I can offer.

Good luck!</ChosenAnswer>
