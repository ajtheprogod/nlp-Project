    <Subject>Since installing malwarebytes, I am no longer able to access a particular web page I  on either IE or Firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>I had been able to access this page anytime until I installed Malwarebytes. I also had upgraded my version of Internet Explorer around the same time as I installed Malwarebytes.  How can I solve this issue?

    <ChosenAnswer>You haven&#039;t given us much to go on. What happens when you try to access the web page?  Does it give you an error page in the browser?  Does a message box come up? What do they say?

About all I can say from the evidence, is that a new version of Internet Explorer should have no effect on Firefox.

Sorry.  Maybe if you post more information someone will be able to help you more.</ChosenAnswer>
