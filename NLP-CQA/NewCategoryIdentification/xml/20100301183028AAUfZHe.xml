    <ChosenAnswer>It won&#039;t take up a lot of space and is better than internet explorer, however I prefer google chrome as it is a smaller file and runs way faster than firefox. You should either download it or chrome and stop using internet explorer.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Your computer might be fragmented, this can cause your computer to become slow overtime. If you were to defrag your computer hard drive chances are it would run as fast as when you first bought it.
