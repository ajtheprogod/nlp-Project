    <Subject>Crazy guy on eBay hints at hurting me, in my house. Advice/comments?</Subject>
    <Content>I bought a watch on eBay, it shipped and I got in time and everything, and I paid for it. However, I didnt give the guy feedback right away when I got it. He said that hurt his rep, and he will do something &#039;&#039;bad to you&#039;&#039;(me). I didnt even talk to this dude, only bid, I left positive feedback about 9 hours later. Then he sent me crap about rep. Would you be scared, and why did I deserve this?
I left him positive feedback before he even sent this crap. He knew the local beach and roads, said he would use a golf club. I didnt even know he was crazy until this.

    <ChosenAnswer>Report him to ebay immediately! This is abuse whether he means it or not. Was this through your ebay messages or regular email? If it was through ebays messages I think there is a report button on that or contact ebays live help for assistance. 
You dont deserve this feedback is voluntary, not compulsory. I would not of let him intimidate me into leaving feedback. I would have reported him &amp; eventually would have left him a negative FB for abuse.
Wonder how many others he has done this to?</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I personally think he&#039;s just trying to scare you. But if he DOES come to your house then of coarse you&#039;ll know what to do, call the cops!</Content>
