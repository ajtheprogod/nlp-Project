    <Subject>Help! Now I can&#039;t find Internet Explorer on the start menu!?</Subject>
    <Content>First the icon was missing from my desktop and some Y.A. hero told me to find it in the start menu. That worked like magic but now it is missing from both the desktop and start men!. How do I get it back? How do I prevent it running away again? I know I&#039;m not a very good cook but this is ridiculous!

            <Content>Go to your Home folder within Places/ , find File system click to bring up the tree of folders, scroll to etc. the browsers should all be under this extension. You could drag the one you want to your desktop folder.

Choice two: Go to Add Remove Programs, Go to the Internet choice in the left margin-click- Scroll down to the browser(s) of your choice in the check off box field and be sure to check mark (with a click) the boxes and push install programs at the bottom if they are not already checked. It might have gotten unchecked somehow. 

The Internet Explorer browser should be in your etc file now if it wasn&#039;t there before.</Content>
