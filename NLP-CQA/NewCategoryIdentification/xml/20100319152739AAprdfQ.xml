    <ChosenAnswer>Before I can help you I would need to know what Operating system are you using? From what I could pick up, is it Windows Vista by chance.
I&#039;ll also need to know what you were doing or what you did prior to getting this message?
Did you just updated your antivirus or your browsers by chance.
Get back to me as soon as possible so that I can try to help you ok.
Though it seems as though something or someone changed your permissions so you should definitely check it out. if everything seems ok then it could be a spyware or malware.
Try installing spybot-search and destroy--&gt;http://download.cnet.com/Spybot-Search-amp-Destroy/3000-8022_4-10122137.html
and scanning your system and you can also try 
running Malwarebytes--&gt;http://www.malwarebytes.org/

Hope this was somewhat helpful but I still need to know what I asked earlier so that I could further assist.</ChosenAnswer>
