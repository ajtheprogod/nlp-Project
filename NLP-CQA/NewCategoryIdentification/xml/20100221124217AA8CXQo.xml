  <Question id="20100221124217AA8CXQo" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I create a website where people send me photos that I put into a slideshow for them?</Subject>
    <Content>I need for the people to have the ability to upload or send me the photos but the photos are only visible to me and/or that specific person not to other people that come visit the website.  I will then transfer the photos to my own hard drive or some other type of storage and remove them off the website.  I am starting up a slideshow business for customers.... I need to know what is the best way to create this website.  Money is not an issue, but I am interested in cost affordable ways if you know any. Please direct me to any sources. Thanks!
PLEASE DON&#039;T GIVE ME ANY ANSWERS ABOUT CREATING SLIDESHOWS! I KNOW HOW TO CREATE THEM. I NEED A WEBSITE PEOPLE. Thanks

    <ChosenAnswer>As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. A domain name is a name you want to call your website (ex: www.yahoo.com). To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I’m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting &amp; I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

You can use this service optionally. You can also create the pages offline with your favorite program (DreamWeaver, FrontPage, Microsoft Publisher, iWeb etc.), and then upload them to your web host. This is another easy way to get your website online.
