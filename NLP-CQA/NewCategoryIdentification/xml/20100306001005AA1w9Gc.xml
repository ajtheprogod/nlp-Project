    <Subject>How much internet is used from watching online tv?</Subject>
    <Content>My parents are getting broadband. They don&#039;t use the internet much which is why they only have dialup at the moment but dad really wants to watch online romanian tv-- he&#039;s found a site that streams it 24/7. Just wondering, how many mb/gbs of internet will be used for each hour of online tv he watches? We need to know how much broadband data to get him per month. This site streams the channel continuously and is free to watch, so is it practically like youtube? Like he&#039;ll watch perhaps 10 minutes that will use up around 20-25 megabytes? The quality of the channel is around the same as old youtube, not HD.

    <ChosenAnswer>streaming video is a transfer of quite a bit of information to and from a computer depending on many things like the connection speed at the time and the status of the servers connected to and the video being watched also if this is a laptop and ur gonna use a broadband card it they arent very fast and the video may stop and load a lot causing many headaches i have 13 years in computers and fix and build them daily...... there is no way to approximate what ur gonna use before the month is up....... get unlimited......but i have never hear of a company charging by the usage unless it is in fact a broadband card for a laptop or other computer but the subsciption cards by the month again are slow and not really worth it</ChosenAnswer>
