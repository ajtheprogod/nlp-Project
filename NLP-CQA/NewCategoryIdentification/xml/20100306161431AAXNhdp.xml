    <ChosenAnswer>try googling specific books, but if that doesn&#039;t work, try www.4shared.com. they have a lot books in pdf format for free. however, there is a short waiting time (usually 10 seconds), and it&#039;s not quite online- you just download them and read them at your own pace.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I have tried also with no luck.  All I can find are the classics basically.  I was told that copy right infringement is the reason you cannot read current books.  I know it is true about Tobias Wolfe as I have tried to find his books on line. Sorry.</Content>

            <Content>It&#039;s like trying to find a free book in a bookshop - you can&#039;t just walk out the shop without buying the book..
The author wouldn&#039;t get the money, nor would the publishers &amp; all that lot behind a manuscript becoming an actual book to read out there in the world :)

I suggest either buying an actual, real book from a bookshop - or online - or purchase online-readable-books ((I&#039;ve never tried to read a book online.. so idk where to go around reading a book online? I don&#039;t want to read a book online..)).

Or audio-books. If you&#039;re not wanting to curl up with a nice, real, new book. Which you&#039;ll have to pay for :)

Or pop to your local library? Loooooan a reaaal book?

Reading things online, and doing thing on the computer, are a real strain to your eyesight. It&#039;s best to be reading from something which isn&#039;t a screen - especially if it&#039;s an actual book, not just a short story.. Even a novella as short as Stevenson&#039;s Strange Case of J &amp; H, that would be an actually insane to read on a computer screen.

Sometimes Audio-Books really help capture things in books.. I haven&#039;t warmed much to them, though, other than the early Harry Potter books when I was much younger (and had real difficulty reading, then, so I didn&#039;t read other than as was necessary in class.. embarrassing) and that was on tape in the car on the ways home etc. .. which doesn&#039;t really count, since I do read now, and I read a fair amount-ish..



So,  read Real books, or listen to Audio-Books :)

[[[added-in. Plus, if you do get a website which offers FREE BOOKS online to read, .. I wouldn&#039;t really trust it. Like, I&#039;d be really suspicious of it. Could be a nasty Virus / Spyware Monster-of-Doom.]]]</Content>
