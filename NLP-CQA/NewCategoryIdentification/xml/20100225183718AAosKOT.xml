  <Question id="20100225183718AAosKOT" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How come I can get online through the a browser, but I can&#039;t get online through games?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay so I like to play internet games (Diablo and Warcraft 3) on my spare time (usually around night). So last night I got on one of my games, and it said I wasn&#039;t able to get online. I went onto something called Steam, when I tried to log in, it said it was having problems. Today I decided to borrow a bunch of &#039;online&#039; games from some friends, I installed them and had the same problem which each one. How come I can use internet to do things such as yahoo, but I can&#039;t use my internet to play games? I turned my modem/router on and off. I recycled them. Reset them. Gave them new names. Called my internet provider (who dropped me 2 minutes into conversation, almost four times too) and no good came out of that. And now recently my internet in general is becoming slower and more harder to work with.
I have my own laptop and just recently I have been buying my own internet.
