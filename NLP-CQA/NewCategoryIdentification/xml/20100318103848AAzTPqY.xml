  <Question id="20100318103848AAzTPqY" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Do you know of any websites that I can upload my designs and place them on items to be sold (Like Salt Life)?</Subject>
    <Content>I am looking for businesses that will allow you to upload your own designs and place them on T-Shirts or whatever, possibly pre-cut decals to put on a vehicle. 

I am wanting to create similar items without having to manage with the shipping and production of the T-shirts or stickers.
