  <Question id="20100228055101AA0buh7" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why is my internet running so slowly?</Subject>
    <Content>I have wireless internet (my landlord&#039;s so I don&#039;t know the ISP or anything).  Usually it runs very quickly and I can easily stream videos online, etc.

For the past three days it&#039;s been running incredibly slowly, for example the google homepage takes 1-2 minutes to load instead of a few seconds.

The only thing that&#039;s changed is that my avast expired so I tried downloading a new one.  It&#039;s on my computer with a little stop sign by the icon and windows vista tells me I have no virus protection, though I ran avast last night and it worked fine.  Not sure if this is even related but I thought I&#039;d mention it just in case.

Any advice on how to fix this is very appreciated!!!
OH - Avast tells me I have no viruses by the way.  I ran norton too and there&#039;s nothing wrong in that sense.

    <ChosenAnswer>if you live in a place where it is overcrowded then it&#039;s most probably due to all the other people downloading files. And you could also try a disk cleanup. Just go to My Computer on your Start panel, right click properties and click disk clean up.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Have you uninstalled the old avast? Maybe it is still installed. You need to uninstall the old one then the new one. And oh, by the way, never run 2 anti-virus at the same time it causes PC slowdown. Choose just 1 of it.

Also, clear your browsing history and cookies. Have a decent registry cleaner, maybe it needs clean-up.</Content>
