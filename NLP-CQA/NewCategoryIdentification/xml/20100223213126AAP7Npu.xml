            <Content>yea its kinda dumb really..

seller sells the item in two ways..

1. bidding(auction)  2. buy it now

option one has a time limit for about one week..if you are the highest bidder for the item till the closing time of item , then u win.if some one bids more than you then you loose..you have to constantly view the item and keep on bidding. if you are the hishest bidder , then.pay the amount and get the item

option two..very simple and tesion free...just click on buy it now , pay and get the item..</Content>
