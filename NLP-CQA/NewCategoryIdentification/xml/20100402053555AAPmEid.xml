            <Content>Personally I use Host Gator and have been very happy with them.  Their customer service is great and they have live online chat so if you don&#039;t feel like talking on the phone you can just chat online with them about whatever problem your having.  And I think their prices are very fair for what you get.  They have different plans to choose from.  And they&#039;re upfront about things other hosting companies aren&#039;t like inode limits and such.</Content>
