    <Subject>Can you receive payments on paypal if you dont have a bank account listed?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a paypal account but dont intend on buying anything, so I dont have a payment option listed.  I am using this just for receiving payments.  Can I still get the payment credited to my account? What will happen if someone makes a payment to me but I dont have a credit card or bank account on the paypal account? Thanks
