    <Subject>Demonoid invitation code?</Subject>
    <Content>Hello,

I am looking for an invitation code to demonoid.  I would like to learn how to upload my torrents as I have some pretty decent stuff to share.

    <ChosenAnswer>Demonoid is now open to the public for registrations so be quick.
If you&#039;re lucky enough to get in then you&#039;ll have to look out for an activation email that will be from gate_keeper and NOT Demonoid.
This can sometimes end up in your Spam folder so be sure to check there if you don&#039;t see it.
Please try and give back at least as much as you take so anything above 1.1 is always appreciated.</ChosenAnswer>
