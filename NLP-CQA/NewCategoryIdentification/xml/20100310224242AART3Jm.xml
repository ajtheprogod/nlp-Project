    <ChosenAnswer>You can&#039;t! You have to pay for it! You don&#039;t need to make your website up all the times. So, buy the domain now and you owned its rights (no one else can buy it for the time period you purchased it for). And leave it as it is. When you are done making your website (after a couple of months like u said in desc) ,  upload it to the domain.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You have to buy your domain name, if you have your aren&#039;t set on one, or someone else can purchase it.  If you don&#039;t know the name want yet or aren&#039;t to picky then just wait to buy it until you are ready to creat your site.</Content>
