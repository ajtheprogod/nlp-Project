    <ChosenAnswer>I tried hundreds of free proxies/vpn&#039;s over many months. All I got out of it was a lot of frustration as they got blocked in short order. Well I got one more thing and that was a virus from one of them that wrecked my HD. Even when they worked for a while they were slow and didn&#039;t support all the web site features. My friend in Riyadh told me about the Personal VPN http://www.surfbouncer.com.  He&#039;s kind of an expert on unblocking sites because he lives in a place where pretty much everything fun is blocked.

Anyway, I tried it a few months ago and it&#039;s been working all the time. I haven&#039;t been blocked since and the sites are 100% functional. With the Personal VPN everything works like it&#039;s supposed to. Once connected you don&#039;t even know it&#039;s there. It&#039;s not free but it works perfectly.</ChosenAnswer>
