  <Question id="20100315114205AAVasuj" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is PriceAngels a trusted/good website to buy Nintendo DSi flashcards?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay, for people that don&#039;t know what priceangels.com is, price angels is a website were you could buy cheap but very cheap stuff. From ds flash carts, to ipod cases, to screen protectors. I think its exactly like dealextreme.com For people that don&#039;t know what dealextreme is, it is almost the same thing. The only problem is that dealextreme doesn&#039;t sell DS flash carts anymore. I wanted to buy one but  they didn&#039;t have them. I searched and found this website which is priceangels.com. They have them. So I bought one but i dont know if it is a good/ trusted site. I never bought something from it. IF YOU HAVE PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION!!!!! THANK YOU!!! :)

    <ChosenAnswer>A friend of mine ordered and it didn&#039;t arrive for weeks! Ordered mine from thumbninja.com and it turned up in a few days.

It should show up eventually but if you want fast delivery its better to pay a little extra for a site with cards in stock!</ChosenAnswer>
