    <ChosenAnswer>No they can&#039;t see it if you don&#039;t have an account. Regardless of being logged in out of Facebook it doesn&#039;t matter because although the two sites are linked you need to create a formspring account before you can post the question and let them know who it&#039;s from. Yours will show up as anonymous.</ChosenAnswer>
