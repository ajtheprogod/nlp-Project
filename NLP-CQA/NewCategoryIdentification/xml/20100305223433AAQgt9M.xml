    <Subject>Amazon issue, can anyone help?</Subject>
    <Content>ok so i was ordering something from &quot;Amazon&quot;(duh) and when i clicked place order on the next page there was a &quot;important message&quot; saying the price of (blank) has changed since it was added to my 
cart (down 86 cents wow) and on the side of the screen it was saying &quot;ready to order?&quot; with &quot;my&quot; order in &quot;shopping cart items--to buy now. i got curies and checked &quot;my account/your orders&quot; and it said ... (suspense)  NOTHING it said there no orders placed. so is this a glitch? did the order not get placed? did the order get placed? WHAT HAPPENED??? &gt;.&lt;
if i buy something online i usually get it off amazon and when ordering i did what i have done countless times added the item(s) to my cart clicked proceed to checkout checked credit card info selected the shipping style that i wanted looked over the ALL the info clicked &quot;place order&quot; then the message popped up i checked &quot;my&quot; shipping records and nothing  
P.S. if you don&#039;t like the question then... DON&#039;T ANSWER IT
