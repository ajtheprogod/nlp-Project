  <Question id="20100222203603AAFnV3l" type="Answered">
    <Subject>HELP!  FireFox, IE, Netscape will not let me access Mail2World.com!?</Subject>
    <Content>Every time I try to go to mail2world.com, my browsers ask for authentication and when I try to close the little window, the page then says &quot;You are not authorized to view this page...&quot;.  It asks for a  username and password but this sort of thing has never happened before in the past and I&#039;ve been using mail2worldcom since 2005!  I&#039;ve tried to get onto the site with two different computers and it does the exact same thing!  Can anyone help me?????????  I need to get to mail2world...it&#039;s where all my contacts are and everything!  I&#039;m panicking!

I&#039;m installing Google Chrome right now to see if it does the same thing.

HELP PLEASE!
Google Chrome is doing it, too.  Any other mail2world.com users having this problem, too?  I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s something with the site, now...

    <ChosenAnswer>It sounds like you might be hitting a proxy server trying to go to the website.  Try it from a computer at a different location (different Internet source)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It&#039;s not you. It&#039;s the site. It does the same thing for me. Obviously, they&#039;ve implemented some sort of security. You need to contact the webmaster or owner of the site.</Content>

            <Content>It seems that you may have to join, even though you&#039;ve been a member since 2005.

I just tried logging onto the webpage, and was immediately greeted with &quot;Enter user name and password for http://mail2world.com&quot;.

I clicked on the Cancel button twice, and was then shown the main page.</Content>
