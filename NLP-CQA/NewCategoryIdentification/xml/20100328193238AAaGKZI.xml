    <Subject>I Have A Question About Downloading Torrents From Isohunt?</Subject>
    <Content>My friend has been downloading torrents from Isohunt for about two weeks now just fine with no problem now until today when he got a message that the torrents are incompatible.  What exactly does that mean?  Thanks.
