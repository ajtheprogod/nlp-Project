    <ChosenAnswer>First of all...
Wow John, that was rude, she was just asking a question, and you had to be rude and give a smart reply that doesnt help.......

Ok now.....
There is an awesome site that pays really well, you are in charge of how much you charge and what you do and when you work... everything.
Its 100% safe.
You can start working today..
All you need is a cam, computer and internet and you can start working... if you want to start immediately.. just go into the live help and ask them to approve you and they will bypass the rest of the people and help you.
You dont pay them anything, its not something where you have to pay to get paid, its a real site that is one of the top webcam sites.
Doesnt matter what size, color you are or what you look like. There is so many customers that there is always someone looking for what you have to offer.
Can be straight, gay, bi, transgender
There is room for everyone.
You get paid every 2 weeks, on time and never short. You can receive a bonus also.
Also, there is options for ONLY friendly cam chat... no nudity or naughty chat
You seriously get paid for having a good time.
I have done this for a few years, its my only job and I on average make $2500 working 4 days/nights a week.......
Also, you can have several model accounts and even have your other half join you and make a couples account and make a lot of money there also!!!!
