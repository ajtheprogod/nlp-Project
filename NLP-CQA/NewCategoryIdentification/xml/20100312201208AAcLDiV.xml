    <Subject>internet explorer for windows 7?</Subject>
    <Content>I have windows 7 and I was wondering how I can remove internet explorer from my computer? I went to add/remove programs and it wasn&#039;t listed and when I searched it on my file menu it didn&#039;t come up as a folder so I could not select the option of uninstalling it. I downloaded firefox and I don&#039;t want internet explorer anymore.

    <ChosenAnswer>Its one of those things that you just should have. Not everything runs with firefox, and IE is a good backup for some programs.</ChosenAnswer>
