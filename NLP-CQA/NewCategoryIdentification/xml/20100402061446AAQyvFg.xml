  <Question id="20100402061446AAQyvFg" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Blogging? Help &amp; Suggestions?</Subject>
    <Content>OKay, so i am interested in blogging, although, i desperately need a topic to write (blog) about. i thought about doing my personal life, and using code names. and have profiles of the people i write about. (almost like role playing with the profiles and descriptions. no pictures of course because its anonymous) but, yet i still need something to write about?! i could focus on high school drama. and observations on people...but truly, i don&#039;t know who would be interested in reading it. lol. any ideas??

here is a little about me to help:
i&#039;m a gymnast &amp; play lacrosse. i&#039;m in high school. lots of drama. next year i will be go to boarding school. over the summer, i have an entire other community with friends, family, and drama that i am within for a month or two. 

by the way, call me kay or daisy. thanks in advance(:
Oh!! and if you have any suggestions on names, too. thank ya(:

    <ChosenAnswer>If you can write this question like this, you might as well have just started your blog with this.
Typically you write about what is on your mind, or you can make it like a journal; what significant thing happened today, this week, etc...  Also write about subjects that interest you, or your views or reviews about &quot;stuff&quot;.

To get some ideas, read a bunch of blogs first.
Wordpress.com
Blogger.com
Are a good places to start.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>It sort of depends on what you want to do with your blog. Whether that&#039;s making money blogging or just expressing yourself. Regardless, you should always blog about what you are passionate about. Readers can tell. 

I recently started a blog about blogging (I&#039;ve been blogging for three years) that you can check out. Below is a link to blogging 101 articles that I wrote.</Content>
