    <ChosenAnswer>Rent.com is actually a really good site, but you will have to make an account. The don&#039;t require money or personal information though, just an email address. It will keep track of what apartments you checked out and if you end up renting an apartment from one of the listings you viewed, you can get $100 for sending them a copy of your lease. It&#039;s a pretty good deal, I&#039;ve done it for all of my apartments. 

If you really don&#039;t want to make an account anywhere, you can browse Craigslist or ApartmentGuide.com. 

Or, if you go to almost any local McDonalds, you can pick up a free Aparment Guide Book, which shows most of the apartment complexes in the area, complete with maps and phone numbers.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Well that&#039;s hard to answer considering I don&#039;t know your area.  Have you tried your local newspapers website?  I would start there, and if that is not productive try wording various searches for the information you want.  If you don&#039;t feel comfortable giving out your email you could always create a spam account and use that for your log in.  they ask for your name, etc but that doesn&#039;t mean you have to give them a real one :)  Good luck with the house search.</Content>
