            <Content>Because the .com was taken. 


I see that .com was registered in August 2007, .org was registered in May of 2008. 

I have a few .org&#039;s and .net&#039;s because the .com&#039;s were taken, but only because they are good keywords. Fail Blog is not a good keyword, so the company that registered the .org is stupid and should have found a better name for their business because now the .com guy has his page parked and is making money off some of their traffic.</Content>

            <Content>There&#039;s a failblog.net as well (as well as a .com) so I&#039;m guessing .org was the only one available :) 

There are not restrictions at the moment though, so they can use whatever they want.</Content>

            <Content>At first the site might have had a free domain but when the owner could pay for an actual domain they might have just chosen .org Just a guess.</Content>
