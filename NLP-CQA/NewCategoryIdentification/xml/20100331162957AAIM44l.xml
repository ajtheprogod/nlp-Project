  <Question id="20100331162957AAIM44l" type="Answered">
    <Subject>VIRUS!! I really need help!!?</Subject>
    <Content>So I wasn&#039;t even doing anything bad on my computer, I was just on iTunes then surfyhechannel.com which my brother said was fine and he hasn&#039;t had any problems with it. So anyways this antivirus suite popped up and I knew the it was a virus itself cause I have had a problem similar to this before so I just exited out of it, but then when I tried to go back on the Internet it wouldn&#039;t let me all it said was this site could be bad or something like that and I couldn&#039;t even go to control programs or anything, so I&#039;m just wondering how to get this off my computer it&#039;s quite important that I get everything back and running.

            <Content>Try a virus scan with your installed anti-virus, making sure to run a &quot;full&quot; scan and NOT a &quot;fast&quot; scan.

You can try a system restore to a date that you know is previous to the date which this issue began.

You can also backup data you need onto discs/flash drive/external hard drive, and reinstall your operating system.</Content>
