            <Content>A lot of times when a person asks a question and it seems random, they actually are looking for an answer.  Maybe the answer is so obvious they can&#039;t figure it out, or nobody will tell them.  You never what&#039;s going on in their life at the time, and they probably are asking it for real!  But then there are those people out there that are just trying to annoy other people or entertain themselves; hopefully not many.</Content>
