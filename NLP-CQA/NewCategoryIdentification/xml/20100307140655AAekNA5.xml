  <Question id="20100307140655AAekNA5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Free Website Hosting?</Subject>
    <Content>I plan on eventually putting a game hopefully MMORPG, also have an image/message board on it, adds don&#039;t really matter as long as they don&#039;t get to much in the way or lag my site, and I would like to have a slightly remember-able url.
I looked at free-webhosts and I&#039;ll use that resource is, yola doesn&#039;t pan out, and I don&#039;t want a forum I want a message/image board that you don&#039;t have to log into and can jsut post as anonymous
