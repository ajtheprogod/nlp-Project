  <Question id="20100329151407AAtBEPm" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What site is best for personal journaling/blogging/diary-keeping?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m looking for a really good personal blogging website. I&#039;ve tried a few so far...

* Xanga
* Livejournal
* Wordpress
* Blogger

None of them are really to my liking. So far, Xanga is my favorite due to its extensive customization abilities.

I&#039;m not in it for profit or socializing or networking. I&#039;m looking for the MOST SECURE and MOST CUSTOMIZABLE blog I can find. I&#039;m one of those people who&#039;s always afraid someone&#039;s going to somehow stumble upon their online diary and ruin their lives with it...so, I want the absolute most secure, private one I can get. (And I&#039;m willing to bet there&#039;s a lot of you who will suggest simply not blogging online if I want it that private -- but, the thing is, I want to be able to access it and write from anywhere. So, no, I don&#039;t want to blog in Microsoft Word or Notepad or anything like that. It&#039;s got to be something I can access from different computers.)

Any ideas?

    <ChosenAnswer>You could always make your own website, if you want it to be private.

You&#039;d have to pay for it if you want it to be truly secure though.</ChosenAnswer>
