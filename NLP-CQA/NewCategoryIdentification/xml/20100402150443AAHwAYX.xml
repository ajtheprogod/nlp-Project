  <Question id="20100402150443AAHwAYX" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why isn&#039;t Mozilla checking my spelling as I type?</Subject>
    <Content>I had to redownload Mozilla when I did a System Recovery, and now when I make a spelling error, it doesn&#039;t underline it with a squiggly red line. I&#039;ve checked the &quot;Check spelling as I type&quot; box in Tools. I&#039;ve unchecked it, closed Mozilla, then checked it again. Do I have to do anything else to enable it?

Thanks.

            <Content>just get google chrome. it is soooo much better in terms of looks and ease of browsing. it even has an &quot;incognito&quot; window you can open up whenever you want to do some &quot;secret&quot; browsing (you know naughty stuff). you can also rearrange the tabs an make a tab into a separate window!</Content>
