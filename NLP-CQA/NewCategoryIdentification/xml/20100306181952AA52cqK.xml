    <Subject>Wireless Internet keeps dropping?</Subject>
    <Content>Recently my wireless internet connection randomly drops then reconnects a few seconds to a minute later.  Its a 2wire router, and the internet drops on my laptop and on my PS3.  I&#039;ve had this wireless internet for a few years now, and this problem did happen until recently. Anyone know what i can do to fix this?
