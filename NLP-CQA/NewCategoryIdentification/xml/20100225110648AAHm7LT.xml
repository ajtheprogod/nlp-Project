    <ChosenAnswer>Avoid Wildblue all you can. It severely limits you and is slower than they say. If you go over your limit ( which can happen on average use just checking emails and your Anti-Virus updating ) you will be shut off to slow-than-dial-up speeds for a week or so. Contract is expensive to get out of, too!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I would go with the Virgin Mobile. Satellite service tends to be sluggish and frequently has limits and throttles.</Content>
