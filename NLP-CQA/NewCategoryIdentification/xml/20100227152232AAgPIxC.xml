  <Question id="20100227152232AAgPIxC" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Could anyone please send me an invitation code for Demonoid?</Subject>
    <Content>I would so love to register at demonoid.com because it seems to be the only tracker that has the files that I want but the user registrations are closed. Even though it is said that they would open them again at the beginning of the month nothing happened so I still can&#039;t register. :(
I would be very thankful if somone would send me an invitation because it seems to be the only way to become a member. Of course I would keep a positive share ratio. ;)

    <ChosenAnswer>Demonoid is now open to the public for registrations so be quick.
If you&#039;re lucky enough to get in then you&#039;ll have to look out for an activation email that will be from gate_keeper and NOT Demonoid.
This can sometimes end up in your Spam folder so be sure to check there if you don&#039;t see it.
Please try and give back at least as much as you take so anything above 1.1 is always appreciated.</ChosenAnswer>
