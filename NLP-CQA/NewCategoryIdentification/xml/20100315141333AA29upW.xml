  <Question id="20100315141333AA29upW" type="Answered">
    <Subject>My Firefox history won&#039;t delete!?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve tried to delete a site off my address bar, and it won&#039;t remove. It lets me delete other sites off the address bar but not this one. I&#039;ve tried deleting EVERYTHING and that doesn&#039;t work! I usually just hit the arrow button down on the address bar and hit &#039;delete&#039; but it keeps popping up. I also tried going to  &quot;Tools&quot; then &quot;Clear recent history&quot; and delete it all, but it keeps coming back! Help!

    <ChosenAnswer>Try running the free, downloadable tool CCleaner: http://download.cnet.com/ccleaner/?tag=mncol
It removes temporary files put in place by browsers like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Chrome. It also cleans unwanted files that Windows leaves behind.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If it is in the Address Bar then it is your Home page and cannot be deleted until you change it.
Run CCleaner and all History will be gone from all browsers.

            <Content>Might be a virus? If you still can&#039;t delete it / it deletes and regenerates try a) launching Firefox in safe mode and deleting b) boot WINDOWS into safe mode and delete c) run Avast and AVG, restart, try again. And I think the other post said CCleaner, thats a really good app.</Content>
