  <Question id="20100316130656AA0MVY3" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why won&#039;t my internet work?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a Dell Inspiron 9 Mini Netbook with the Ubuntu Linux operating system. I work off of a WIFI network for Shasta College. I try to click on my browser icon and it says that my internet is loading but then stops and disappears. Its getting very frustrating and I need to figure out why it is doing that.

    <ChosenAnswer>It could be a myriad of issues. 

Assuming it has worked before, I will rule out incompatible drivers and anything having to do with the actual hardware (but you never know).

I&#039;m also assuming that you&#039;re receiving a full signal on the wifi.

Software settings are probably the issue. 

Check your connection settings. Are you TCP/IP settings set to dynamic or static? Are you running any firewall/antivirus that is blocking certain ports?

Most College campuses require that you install some additional software before being allowed to connect to their wifi network. You might be missing that software (again, you never know). I would give Shasta IT department a quick call to see if they have any recommendations for you.</ChosenAnswer>
