    <ChosenAnswer>If you&#039;re running wifi on vista/xp you can going to network &amp; sharing connection, then try repairing.
If that doesn&#039;t work try disconnecting &amp; connecting.
If that doesn&#039;t work try checking your router, it probably has a plug loose that barely passes a signal.
