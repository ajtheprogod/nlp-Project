    <Subject>Does Amazon.co.uk always apply Custom Duties?</Subject>
    <Content>Im in the UK, and would like to order a cd from the states, via UK&#039;s Amazon&#039;s Marketplace. However it says that customs duties may be incurred. Do they apply them? Or is it a 50/50 chance they may or may not. The cd is only £5, however if duties are added, it will be £15. So do amazon always apply these charges, or is it a chance I take? Thanks :)
Ordering from a Californian company if that makes a difference
I have read that page, however, it says &#039;may be subject&#039;. So still doesnt resolve it : (

            <Content>You should read the Customs Information Page on Amazon 

http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=502492


Neither duty nor VAT is payable if the total value of the goods (not including shipping charges or insurance) does not exceed £18 (€22, or equivalent in local currency).</Content>
