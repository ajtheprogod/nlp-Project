    <Subject>Does your activity on Limewire show on your Internet History?</Subject>
    <Content>Does your activity, such as what you have downloaded on Limewire, show up on Internet history. Or could you see it from a different computer, eg. if there were three or four laptops using the same WIFI, could the others possibly see what you&#039;ve downloaded?
