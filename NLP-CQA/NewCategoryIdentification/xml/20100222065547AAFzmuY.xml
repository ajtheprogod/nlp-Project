  <Question id="20100222065547AAFzmuY" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why I cannot connect to the Web using any browser but can connect using the My Computer icon?</Subject>
    <Content>My computer running XP was infected with a spyware a couple weeks ago (XP SecurityCenter). I manually removed it or blocked it but now my neither IE or Firefox can connect to the Web. I can connect using the My Computer icon (I think is Windows explorer) and can browse the web but can not use any browser. Any suggestions? When my computer was infected the fake XP SecurityCenter spyware blocked my browser and force it to go run their malware program.
