    <ChosenAnswer>Nope. The article avcs posted is fake. IT was a prank someone was trying to do.

            <Content>Supposedly the CEO&#039;s of Formspring were planning this since they made it. The owner was using Honesty Box on Facebook and decided it would be cool to do something like that and one day have everyone see who was really writing it. He&#039;s been saving everyone&#039;s information when something was posted anonymously. When you sign up for Formspring, you agree to terms where he can do something like this. I&#039;m hoping they stop him from doing it, but supposedly it&#039;s perfectly legal.</Content>

            <Content>Probably not.  I freaked out at first too, then I realized the link posted by the person above me is a blog, not &quot;Associated Press&quot;

So it&#039;s probably fake.</Content>
