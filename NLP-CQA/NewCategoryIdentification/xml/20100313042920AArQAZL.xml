    <ChosenAnswer>It looks like there is a redirect on that page that is broken.

Try www.ubi.com/enca/ instead

If you still have problems, it&#039;s likely that pirates are maliciously attacking ubi servers due to the unpopular decision to make new games unplayable unless you have a good online connection with their servers.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Try using a proxy server,  and do the click things again .
see if the error pups up again.
if it doesn&#039;t then there is something wrong about your internet ip address location, service or etc.</Content>
