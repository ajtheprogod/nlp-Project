  <Question id="20100322225320AAPEyA5" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does this happen to any of y&#039;all?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay i&#039;ve been using yahoo answers for a while now.
On my profile I made it to where people may instant message me or email me if they like.Usually to contact eachother about yahoo answer questions or just to have a nice chat.But i&#039;ve been getting these instant messages from these sluts who want me to see there cam or these horny ass guys who just talk about sex. i&#039;m engaged and everything and my man wouldn&#039;t like that shit...ya know?
Then when i tell them off they say your problem is..is that your a virgin.I&#039;m like for 1.... i have a STD which would make it impossible for me to be a virgin.2 i&#039;m faithful in my relationships. So does any of this every happen to any of you. thanks.I will vote for best answer. Sorry i don&#039;t think i put it in the right category.
Okay i do have an STD but that doesn&#039;t mean that I&#039;m unfaithful in the past relationships that I&#039;ve had.Just means that someone i was dating 2 years ago told me that he was clean when he wasn&#039;t....Sad thing was...after i got an outbreak he still didn&#039;t know that he had it. lol.I found out from his ex girlfriend lol

            <Content>It&#039;s good that you&#039;re faithful in your relationships.  A key point is to have just one relationship at a time.  And if you&#039;re faithful, how do you get a STD?</Content>
