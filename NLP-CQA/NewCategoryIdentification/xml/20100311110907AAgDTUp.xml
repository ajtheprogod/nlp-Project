I would really like to be able to see the bonus features of this movie. I&#039;m very interested in the design of movies and cannot find it to download. It&#039;s not out on DVD where I am
Not on youtube
Oh, I just want to add that I will be buying the movie, over here it&#039;s very slow for bringing out DVDs, and I&#039;ll have it downloaded until it comes out

    <ChosenAnswer>You will have to wait until April 22nd when the DVD comes out. No one has it yet. So obviously you can&#039;t find it on the internet.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Nothing legal.
Illegal downloads put a serious dent in the profits from the movie making a sequel unlikely.  It is the revenue from sales (DVD&#039;s etc.) of a new/current movie that provides the money to make the next movie - therefore no legal authorized download</Content>
