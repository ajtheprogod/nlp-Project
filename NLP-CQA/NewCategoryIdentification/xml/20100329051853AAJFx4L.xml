  <Question id="20100329051853AAJFx4L" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Twitter Q: Why have some of my Tweets disappeared from my home page?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve just signed back into Twitter after a few days and I&#039;m shocked to find all but one of my remarks from last Sunday are missing. There was nothing controversial or any swearing involved. I can only recall one regarding the football which said &quot;Normal service resumed at Old Trafford&quot; when United equalized. Hardly the stuff to excite potential censors!

Does anyone know why or if this is a normal occurrence?
