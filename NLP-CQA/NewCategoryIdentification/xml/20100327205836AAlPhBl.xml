    <ChosenAnswer>You can watch Korean Dramas online, without having to fuss with downloading and also downloading a torrent downloader... (phew~)

(You said that it takes to long to buffer and load. This site doesn&#039;t take long at all the load. It&#039;s actually a very good website, used by a lot of people. It&#039;s so much faster than having to download every single episode.)
go to mysoju.com
they have subtitles to every drama and they have all the drama that you&#039;re looking for. 

^^ I hope it helped.</ChosenAnswer>
