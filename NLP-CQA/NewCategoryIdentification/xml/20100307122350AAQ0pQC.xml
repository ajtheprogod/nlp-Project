  <Question id="20100307122350AAQ0pQC" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Should I trust this guy who is buying something from me on Craigslist?</Subject>
    <Content>He wants to pay via Certified Check that he will send to me with a one day express delivery. I have no idea where he actually lives. He offered me a rediculously good price for it, which raises my suspicion even more. On top of that, he promises that I will not be responsible for shipping, as he will have his mover pick up the thing I am selling as soon as I recieve the check.

It sounds too good to be true, which is why I think it&#039;s sketchy. Tell me what you think I should do.

    <ChosenAnswer>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

This is why you do your craigslist transactions in person, and in cash.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I agree it&#039;s sketchy. Offering more than it&#039;s worth and paying with a &quot;certified&quot; check is a common scam. The check is most likely a forgery. Tell him you won&#039;t give him the merchandise until the check clears, 7 to 10 business days. If he agrees (highly doubtful), wait until the bank can confirm the check is legit. Then call him to pick it up. If he refuses, tell him you must have cash then.</Content>
