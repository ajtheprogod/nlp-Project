  <Question id="20100306100046AARnpSj" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is JQSIEStartDetectorImpl Class?</Subject>
    <Content>The ads that slide down a news page I&#039;m trying to read are really starting to annoy me, so I&#039;m trying to find out just what ActiveX control runs them so that I can disable it (I assume they are run by an ActiveX control; I certainly could be wrong). The Properties box in the ad is no help at all, and there is no &quot;View Source&quot; option. So I&#039;m going through all my browser add-ons to see if any look like they could be the culprit, especially those that run without requiring permission. Can anyone help me before I completely crash my PC?
