  <Question id="20100222072906AAsU7PM" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How quickly should an ebay seller acknowledge payment?</Subject>
    <Content>I won a low value item from a casual seller (about 100 feedback - not a pro) a few days back and paid instantly via paypal. I haven&#039;t received any response from him/her and the item is not marked as dispatched. I&#039;m not one of those pain in the arse ebayers who thinks that items *must* be dispatched within 2.5 seconds of the auction ending and I have no particular reason to think I&#039;m being ripped off but the silence is a bit perturbing. How soon can I contact them to chase up a response without being seen as hassling them?

            <Content>It is not hasselling them. You paid for an item and you would like to know its status.</Content>

            <Content>Just message them and casually ask if they recieved payment ok, if they&#039;ve posted, you&#039;ll leave feedback on arrival of goods etc. I always mail my buyers once I&#039;ve posted an item and always mark the dispatched box, many don&#039;t and I hate it.</Content>

            <Content>Ebay/Paypal themselves should have sent you a message to say your payment has been sent (and even then the message system has been intermittent for many months now)
Check in your item won and see if the seller has marked as despatched
If you paid for 2nd class prob on its way; however wont do any harm to ask the seller if and when they dispatched your item.
You would not be hassling me if after a few days you did not know anything
Mark the stars accordingly</Content>
