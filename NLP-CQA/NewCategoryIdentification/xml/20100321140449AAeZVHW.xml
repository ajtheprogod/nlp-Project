  <Question id="20100321140449AAeZVHW" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What is the best site to use for an email account for minors?</Subject>
    <Content>G-Mail has no provisions for minors, so don&#039;t suggest that. Yahoo has more obscene unsolicited junk mail than one could imagine, and their spam filter stinks.
Any suggestions?
