  <Question id="20100327155727AA83Gqu" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I get my &quot;Pranks&quot; site known?</Subject>
    <Content>I just started a website dedicated to Pranks and Practical Jokes (http://www.realdamnfunny.com) and I really need to know how to spread the word without spending more money. So far I&#039;ve used the common methods like Facebook and Myspace and I&#039;ve submitted the site to google and other search engines but it doesn&#039;t seem to be too effective. If there is some way I can link my site to other sites or get other people to do that, please let me know. Please check out the site and let me know if there is anything I need to do to Spice it up as well, THANKS!
