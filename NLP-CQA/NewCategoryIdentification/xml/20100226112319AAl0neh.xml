  <Question id="20100226112319AAl0neh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Where can I sell sex toys legally online?</Subject>
    <Content>Well I bought it less than a week ago and it has been used less than 5 times, so its in almost excellent shape. Again, before you criticize me or call me irrational, it is too much hassle and just not worth the price, and I know someone is willing to buy it, I am willing to sell it very cheap, since it normally has a price tag of $80, I know I might be able to get at least $20. The problem is ebay and amazon don&#039;t allow this, and I don&#039;t really know any other trustworthy sites to sell stuff on like this. Again don&#039;t question me, just answer this because the longer I wait the less likely someone is willing to buy.

    <ChosenAnswer>ebay and amazon do allow it, there are adult sections that are very well hidden on thier site.  Couldn&#039;t tell you how to get there really but I&#039;ve shopped for them on both sites before.  Just go to one of the sites and look up vibrator, cock ring or something and you&#039;ll find the category.

The second link talks about the &quot;Adult Only&quot; category of ebay.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>If someone&#039;s going to buy a used sex toy, its probably going to be someone on Craigslist.

Craigslist does allow the sale of sex toys.</Content>
