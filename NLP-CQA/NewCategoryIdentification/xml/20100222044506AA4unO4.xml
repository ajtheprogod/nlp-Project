  <Question id="20100222044506AA4unO4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I need help with RapidShare.......?</Subject>
    <Content>I want to download a RapidShare file, it&#039;s not the first time i use RapidShare but first time i have a problem like this.
When i click &quot;free user&quot; appears:
&quot;You have reached the download limit for free-users. Would you like more?
Get your own premium account now! Instant download access! Or try again in about 14 minutes&quot;
but i have 2 weeks to download a file.......
I wait 14 minutes and trying again but this time i take this message:
&quot;Your IP address 91.138. . is already downloading a file. Please wait until the download is completed.&quot;

It&#039;s my computer&#039;s problem or RapidShare&#039;s fault?
Does anyone have any idea why this is happen and how to fix it?

Thanks in advance :)

    <ChosenAnswer>yeah...i&#039;ve experienced that before...its rapidshare fault...
but why don&#039;t use other servers like hotfile or netload or megaupload or deposit files.....if at all the file you&#039;re tryin to download is stored on other servers too.....

            <Content>It&#039;s a common error.
It happens most of the time when all Rapid Share servers are full
The easiest and the fastest way is to get a premium account!!!!
You can also use the following fast, easy and famous free file hosting services :

http://www.hotfile.com

http://www.storage.to

Gooooooooooood luck !!!!!! : )</Content>
