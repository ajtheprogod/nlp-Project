    <ChosenAnswer>yeah maybe the used ones probably don&#039;t work or have crazy scratches on &#039;em, safest is to pay through paypal I know for ebay if the product is not what is described they refund your money or give u another one no extra charge. its called buyer protection doesn&#039;t look like amazon has it.</ChosenAnswer>
