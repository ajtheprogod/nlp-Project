    <Subject>Mega Video Download, know it won&#039;t play?</Subject>
    <Content>I downloaded a video from mega video and it downloaded completely but know it won&#039;t play, it says it&#039;s in a MKV file if that matters, but I downloaded it twice both times I can&#039;t play it on anything?
Anyone know what&#039;s the matter/how I can fix it?
Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>what&#039;s your video player?
you can try to convert MKV to other formats that your player support by using a program.
i recently found a strong power hd video converter--its WinX HD Video Converter Deluxe,it can support Multi-track HD video, such as BDAV, M2TS, MKV, AVCHD, HDTV and MPEG-TS video movies.and of course portable and console players.
free download here: http://www.winxdvd.com/hd-video-converte…

btw,its given away until March 15.
hope it helps you.^-^</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>First, which media player do u use? Maybe your player cant support mkv format.
Try VCL or Gom player which can both play mkv files.</Content>
