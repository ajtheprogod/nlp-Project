    <ChosenAnswer>Hi there. 

Whilst I can&#039;t comment on Madbid, I can comment on another leading penny auction site that is, in my opinion, much better - though I should admit now that I am biased as I am a member of the team that founded it.

www.flutterooo.co.uk is a penny auction site that is 100% genuine and fair, and the prices are genuine too. We have recently sold an ipod touch for 28p, a Sony Bravia TV for 58p, a Nintendo Wii for 36p, a Nano for 15p and many more cool products at amazing prices. You can check out the results at https://www.flutteroo.co.uk/auction-results/

Bidders can win products at these very low prices by taking part in penny auctions or lowest unique bid auctions. All players pay for each bid they place and the winner gets the product (or sometimes a cash alternative) for the winning price. 

Of course there are also losing players in every auction too, so you have to bear that in mind and consider your bidding strategies carefully to give you the best chance of success. 

Check out the video link (http://everydaystream.tv/tag/internet/) which shows one of our most successful customers, and all the products they have won in recent months. Alternatively check out our fan page on facebook (http://www.facebook.com/Flutteroo) to see what others have said about us.

There are many other penny auction sites out there that may not be run quite as fairly or honestly, but ours is 100% honest and transparent. No members of the flutteroo team are allowed to bid under any circumstances and all auctions are run fairly, with only genuine bidders taking part.


Happy bidding

cheers
