            <Content>They are more than scams. Most of time they get their survey done and say movie/survey is not available in your country  Sometimes you complete the survey and they will say you are not eligible or things like you mentioned. Forget them.</Content>

            <Content>Webmasters add surveys now cause there are a lot of auto bots to copy the movies. They are only using surveys to be sure that the visitor is human and not an automated bot. Since hackers found a way to bypass capchas, they use surveys now. Those are only 2-3 mins surveys and after that you&#039;l be able to watch a movie for almost 2 hours, worth it!

            <Content>It isn&#039;t that not all of these websites aren&#039;t safe, often they will be safe other than just being annoying. The problem is a lot of the time they are just total scams, the reason why you can only find that particular movie behind a survey screen instead of anywhere else is because it isn&#039;t available on the internet yet, so even if you fill out the survey you&#039;ll just get a message saying wooops sorry its been taken down.

As owners of sites like that are likely to be untrustworthy types then its also quite likely they wont mind using the ads that pay high but deliver virus&#039; to peoples computers, this won&#039;t always be the case but frankly why take the risk when 90% of the time you are just being scammed anyway.</Content>
