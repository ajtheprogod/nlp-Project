If you need a place to store any of your files on the Internet for safe access later then use 4Shared, it&#039;s a free online virtual drive; you can share your files if you wish or you can just keep them to yourself. It&#039;s free and easy to use and it keeps all your files safe, just visit http://www.4shared.com/ and signup to get started.
