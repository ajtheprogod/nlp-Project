  <Question id="20100309072302AAPg8QR" type="Answered">
    <Subject>If you create a twitter account - does the whole world have to see it and your profile?</Subject>
    <Content>i&#039;m a newb when it comes to these social networking sites (myspace, facebook, twitter etc )

i have a rough idea as to what they&#039;re all about, and so forth but I was wondering how much privacy and anonimity you could have should you wish to remain unsearachable by complete and total strangers.

secondly is it compulsory to upload a photograph of yourself in the profile sections of these sites ?

one of the reasons I don&#039;t upload anything about my life on the internet is simply because - I don&#039;t trust the vast majority of people who gain access to the internet and do god knows what with your personal profile info,  photos, movies etc.

i&#039;m confident and pretty certain that average internet user uploads/provides enough personal information about themselves online, for any external entity out there to find - arrange into a way as to build a complete and accurate character of oneself.

i wish to consider creating a &#039;twitter&#039; account now - but only so that close trustees and family can gain access to it and view it and share information with me.

nobody else.

can this be done ?
