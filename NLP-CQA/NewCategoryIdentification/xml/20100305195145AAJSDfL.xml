  <Question id="20100305195145AAJSDfL" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What do you use tabs for when browsing the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>This is a study for a project.  Also, if you have anything to say about why you think tabs became popular in the BIG picture of things since their introduction in 1997, that would be good too.

Thank you for your participation!

    <ChosenAnswer>The best answer would be that you can keep lots of pages open at once.  I refer to many while doing my college assignments.  I also like to have a tab with pandora.com open so that I can listen to some good music while surfing.

My best use of tabs would be for cross-referencing.  I will be reading an article on Wikipedia and come across something interesting, center click it to open it in a new tab (firefox) and then it will be ready when I finish the article.  This way I can juggle many different topics at the same time.</ChosenAnswer>
