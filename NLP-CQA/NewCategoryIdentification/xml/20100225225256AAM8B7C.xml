  <Question id="20100225225256AAM8B7C" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why is my firefox doing this.?</Subject>
    <Content>I use mozilla firefox, and the other day i opened up a new browser and i got this
&quot;Unable to connect
Firefox can&#039;t establish a connection to the server at www.ask.com
*   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
          moments.

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer&#039;s network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the web&quot;

And i even deleted the file and redownloaded it and it still says that.

Anyone know what i can do to fix it?

Oh and the ask.com is what pops up whenever i open a new browser.
I just did what you told me to do and i still get what i&#039;ve been getting.

            <Content>your network settings have been compromised.

Try:   Tools - Options - Advanced - Network - Connection - Settings

If you are the usual internet user, it should be set to &quot;no proxy&quot;

Any other setting should be reset to &quot;no proxy&quot;.

If you use a server (unlikely), then the network points to the server for internet access.</Content>
