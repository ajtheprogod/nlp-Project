    <Subject>Block websites, and media?</Subject>
    <Content>I am playing a prank on my family, I made a second Firefox profile and I want to mess with them by blocking certain websites, and making it seem like videos won&#039;t work and etc. It has to seem like it is the internet or the website itself is having a problem though. If possible, if anyone knows how to set up the administer account to block installing new programs as well. Thanks in advance!

    <ChosenAnswer>you can block websites by adding a fake IP in your HOSTS file, or install adblock and just block the entire web site.

another option would be to install foxyproxy and set up a rule for just those web sites</ChosenAnswer>
