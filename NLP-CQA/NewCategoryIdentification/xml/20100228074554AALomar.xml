    <ChosenAnswer>If you like to win and have fun. Swagbucks. Its just like google. As you search you randomly win swagbucks that are good to purchase prizes from the swagstore. I use my swagbucks to purchase amazon gift cards. Ive made way over $50 in amazon. Try it out! http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee</ChosenAnswer>
