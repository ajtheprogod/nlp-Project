    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;m an American expat in Germany, and I know how hard it is to find advice!  The only thing that I can say is that the company will not help you (tax, legal and liability reasons).  I&#039;d suggest asking any friends you have in the UK to recieve the package for you and then to ship it to you privately.  Good luck!</ChosenAnswer>
