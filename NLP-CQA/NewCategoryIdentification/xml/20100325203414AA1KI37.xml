    <ChosenAnswer>Clear the cache of the browser your in and see if that helps. It always does for me whenever my sites feel slow.

You could also try opening command prompt and typing in &quot;ipconfig /flushdns&quot; without quotes. Worth a shot.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I have no idea dude. But notdoppler.com is a cool web site. I went to it to see if it would work on my comp. to make sure it wasn&#039;t a downed server, and it wasn&#039;t. It works fine on my comp, and I like it, so I think I&#039;ll get back to it.</Content>
