    <ChosenAnswer>It&#039;s a way of keeping up with people and events. You post 140 character status updates on what you&#039;re doing, basically like a facebook status. You &quot;follow&quot; other people and see what they&#039;re up to. They can be friends, organizations or even famous people.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Ok, on Twitter you tell your family and friends [People who follow you] about what you&#039;re doing; in 140 characters or less. A bit more space than a MSN personal message.
@USERNAME at the beginning of whatever you wrote means it&#039;s to that person. It&#039;l be a link to their profile. If you write @USERNAME in the message, it&#039;ll just link to them.
A RT or ReTweet is basically sharing what someone wrote. You click on the ReTweet button on the Tweet you want to ReTweet, and it&#039;ll show up on your profile, telling your followers.
That&#039;s the basics.</Content>
