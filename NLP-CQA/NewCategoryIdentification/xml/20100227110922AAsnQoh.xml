  <Question id="20100227110922AAsnQoh" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Onlien flash slideshow creator?</Subject>
    <Content>I need to find a flash slideshow creator that is free and no download. I found one a while ago. But I lost it. I don&#039;t want one with special effects. Just like 5 pictures put together that move fast. The one I found had an example, it was a stuffed dog getting closer and closer to the screen. That one was easy to use and no download! If you know what website I&#039;m talking about, please tell me that one. But If not, just give me a website that I can use: NO special effects, NO download

            <Content>I am sorry that i can&#039;t help you if you mean create a photo tile through the internet. 
However, if you are interested in downloading a software. I can recommend you a nice 
one. Using that one, you can add all kinds of transitions, decorations like caption, 
background music, etc. between photos.

Have a try, I guess you will like it.
