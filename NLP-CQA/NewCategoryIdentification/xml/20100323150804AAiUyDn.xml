    <ChosenAnswer>You cannot buy backstage tickets or passes but you can get them for free.  I used to do it all the time when I was younger. Just check out http://www.igotbackstagepasses.com  for details.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>usually you have to be tight with the band, their management, or the promoter. that or a hot chick. chances are slim and none to buying them. they are given to roadies, venue people, etc.</Content>
