    <ChosenAnswer>well, if you have ticked in setting that cookie is valid for 2 weeks, then it will expire after that.
You can put it for 1 day, and then it expires.

my advise, clear your privacy every time you use someone&#039;s PC.

easiest is to use keyboard shortcuts.

in IE8, and Firefox use CTRL + SHIFT + DELETE and select all and you&#039;re done.
in Opera, goto Tools/Delete Privacy data, tick all things you want to delete and press OK.
