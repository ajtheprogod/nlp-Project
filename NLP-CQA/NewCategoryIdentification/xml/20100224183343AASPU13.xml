    <ChosenAnswer>Hi! I use Internet Explorer as well. You&#039;ll see somewhere at the top of the page &quot;Tools.&quot; Click this, and a menu should drop down. Now, click on &quot;Internet Options.&quot; First it&#039;ll have your home page options. If you haven&#039;t already, type in whatever page you want your home page to be. Somewhere below that you&#039;ll see the subtitle &quot;Tabs.&quot; Click &quot;Settings&quot; on the right of that and it&#039;ll open up another window. You&#039;ll then see something that says, &quot;When a new tab is opened, open:&quot; and then a drop-down menu. Click on this and select the home page option. I hope I helped! If this isn&#039;t working (I may be using a different version), let me know and I&#039;ll correct it right away. Also, feel free to send me a message if you have any other questions.

Edit: Zorro is right. I guess I just took longer to explain it haha. Uhm, I please pick me for best answer? (Yes, I&#039;m aware that asking to be chosen for best answer would probably lessen my chances of being chosen for best answer, but what the heck. I wanna keep my best answer thing at 100%.)  (:

Edit#2: MyDigitalDeals is incorrect. The homepage option is just to change your default homepage, it doesn&#039;t affect how a tab opens. However, if you&#039;d like more than one tab to open whenever you go to your homepage (for example, you could have Google open and then have another open tab that&#039;s, let&#039;s say, YouTube), type in your main homepage (the one you want to open first), then go to next line (Enter/Return) and type in whatever other tab(s) you want open. You can have many if you&#039;d like. :D (If my explanation is at all confusing, feel free to let me know and I&#039;ll try to explain it as simply as possible.</ChosenAnswer>
