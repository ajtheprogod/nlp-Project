  <Question id="20100308203922AAThLnu" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does anyone know anything about Mozilla Firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>Ohk, my little sister installed a yahoo tool bar to both firefox and explorer, so I uninstalled it but after I did I noticed that every time I opened a new tab it would go to this web site http://search.yahoo.com/?fr=freeze&amp;type=W3i_NA,132,3_6,Tab%20Search,20100209,6374,0,15,0 But I want it to open up to a blank tab. I tried using add ons to change it but still no luck so help please! its driving me bananas haha. I&#039;ve thought about just redownloading firefox but I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll lose all my Bookmarks. So any help would be great. Keep in mind that is my tabs not my homepage I know how to change that.

    <ChosenAnswer>No, dont redownload firefox!
I had the same problem,

Okay, so go to Tools
Then click on Add Ons
Then go on Extensions
It probably says &quot;My.Freeze.com Net Assistant&quot; as one of the options
Have it selected, and then click on Uninstall

That gets you back to having a blank tab when you click for a new tab.
You dont have to uninstall the Yahoo toolbar, this is separate from it.</ChosenAnswer>
