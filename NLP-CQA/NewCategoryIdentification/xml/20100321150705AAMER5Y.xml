    <Subject>What was the name of that site where you make those really cute asian photos?</Subject>
    <Content>My friend sent me a link of this site and it had all those asian pictures with decorative stuff around the frame/border of the pic. (It was a site mainly for girls) and my friend wants it, but i cant remember the site at all T_T. Basically, you would upload a photo and then add/edit stuff or decorations to your photo
