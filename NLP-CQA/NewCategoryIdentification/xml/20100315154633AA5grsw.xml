    <ChosenAnswer>Go to &quot;Tools&quot; and click on &quot;Add-Ons&quot;.  Find the tab that says &quot;Themes&quot; (with a color palette and paintbrush icon on it).  From here there should be a list of all the themes you currently have installed.  You can either &quot;Disable&quot; a theme, which means your browser will no longer use the theme, but it will still be there if you want it again, or you can &quot;Uninstall&quot; it, which removes it from your browser completely.  If you uninstall and want it again, you can always reinstall it from the Firefox website :)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>tools-addons-themes, then select the &#039;default&#039; theme, it will ask you to restart firefox, click it and y0ou will be back to normal. btw i suggest using lavafox v1 blue :) very cool and interactive. also, you could just install another theme and it would immediately go to that one.</Content>
