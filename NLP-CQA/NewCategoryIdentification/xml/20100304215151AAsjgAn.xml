            <Content>It depends on your maturity level. Frankly once you get an email address, you will most probably start getting unwanted spam mail (unsolicited email, sometimes from unknown people) that talk about things that young people do not understand completely.

If your parents are computer savvy, they will be more likely to get you an address than those who are not. However I strongly recommend that your email address be monitored by your parents also. Of course, you will get a private email address when you have grown up and can handle the good and bad things commonly available on the Internet, but at this age, it is best to allow your parents to also see your emails.</Content>
