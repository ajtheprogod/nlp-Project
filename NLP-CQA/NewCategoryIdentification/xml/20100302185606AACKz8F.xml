    <ChosenAnswer>Go to your page and then click &quot;customize.&quot;  Under the info tab, there&#039;s a bolded section called &quot;Portrait Photo&quot;  After you&#039;ve located that, simply choose the profile picture you want from your computer and click upload. 
    If you want your picture to appear on your blog page and not just as the browser icon, it depends on what theme you use.

If that&#039;s not what you meant or if you&#039;re having trouble, feel free to message me via tumblr :)</ChosenAnswer>
