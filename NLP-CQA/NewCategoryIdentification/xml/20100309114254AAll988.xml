    <Subject>Firefox doesn&#039;t fill in passwords after update to 3.6?</Subject>
    <Content>Yesterday I upgraded from Mozilla Firefox version 2.0 to version 3.6.  Now whenever I go to a website that previously already had my username and password in there for me, those fields are blank.  I have to retype my username and password in and then it asked me if I want it to save my password...as though I don&#039;t have a password already saved for that site.

It seems as though somehow it &quot;forgot&quot; how to find my old passwords even though I simply chose the upgrade option for Firefox when I upgraded to version 3.6.
I found out what the problem was.  There were a few sites that I had saved passwords at that I had to force the saving of and those were the only passwords that weren&#039;t auto filling in.
