    <ChosenAnswer>It could be real but most likely they are just trying to get you to sign up for something.  It could also be a site that gets you to click on the link and than gives you a virus.  Be careful.

So I was curious and clicked on it and it is a page created by some immature guy who is showing pics of his ex - gf but still looks like the front page is a teaser to try to get you to pay.

Reality:  Lauren and Ben prob really don&#039;t exist.</ChosenAnswer>
