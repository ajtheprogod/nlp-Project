    <ChosenAnswer>Starting a blog about hair style is a great idea! 

I&#039;ve been blogging for three years and I can tell you that the trick to starting a blog that reaches a large audience is to find a topic that is untapped. There are lot&#039;s of bloggers blogging about baseball, internet marketing, politics but not many &#039;hair style&#039; blogs. 

If you really want to have a good brand, you should purchase your own domain ( http://www.blogtap.net/buying-a-domain-for-your-blog/ ) and then self-host the blog: http://www.blogtap.net/how-to-host-your-own-blog-in-5-easy-steps/
You can download free, open-source blogging software at wordpress.org. You can also choose to not buy a domain and not-self host (all free). WordPress.com is a good site for doing that.

Even if you are passionate about your topic, the readers will not always just come. That is why you should market your blog with social sharing sites, link building, guest blogging, SEO, etc. This may sound overwhelming at first but I started a blog recently to teach non-blogger people how to do this. Leave a comment and I will be glad to answer your question, sometimes with an entire blog post. You can check it out in the link below.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I think that youtube would be a good idea too, to like, do vlogs?
So you don&#039;t just have to explain what your doing but actually show it as well. 
You can do product hauls, like if you use certain hair products you can show the viewers what kind of stuff you buy!
Its awesome, and I personally love vloggers, you learn so much stuff!</Content>
            <Reference>Me, I am a subscriber to nearly 5 different people who do hair and make-up tutorials on Youtube.</Reference>
