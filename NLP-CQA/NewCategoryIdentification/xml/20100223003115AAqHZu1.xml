  <Question id="20100223003115AAqHZu1" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What did Rupert Murdoch mean when he said the current days of internet are over?</Subject>
    <Content>The basic belief is that once they control the ISP&#039;s then they can start charging every time you visit a site, and also censoring out all the small time bloggers etc that have been stealing content from the major news media. Is this what he&#039;s talking about? He said it could start in twelve months or so.

How does it work and how&#039;s the internet going to operate once they&#039;ve protected their interests by screwing everyone they don&#039;t own already?

Any knowledge of this???

        <Answer>
            <Content>Murdoch owns several newspapers. I think he&#039;s trying to discredit the internet because it is bringing traditional newspapers to an end.</Content>
