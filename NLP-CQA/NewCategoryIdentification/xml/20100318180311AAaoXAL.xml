    <Subject>What websites could I trust to get a new computer at no price?</Subject>
    <Content>My parents say that a lot of websites that inform me to buy a computer for free are a bunch of scams, and could infect the computer I currently use. Isn&#039;t there any websites I can trust so that I can get a new computer for free, and won&#039;t infect the computer I currently use?

            <Content>Your parents are right. ALL of those site are just scams that get YOU to make money for them.

In Example:Rewards1, prizerebel, swagbucks, etc.

Then there are the ones that do nothing and just waste your time. In Example: Lockerz.

Then there are ones that are just obvious spam aka the ones in google ads or the ones in ads.</Content>

            <Content>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

There is no such thing as a free lunch.

A bargain basement new laptop is at least $350, maybe $300 for a netbook, and those are so slow they barely work.  You need to spend at least $400-450 to get a functioning computer.  Why would a website give them away for free?  How could they?  True, you can earn points with surveys, etc., but for you to be able to &#039;earn&#039; a free laptop, you&#039;d have to do quite a bit of work.  Or give them enough information to scam you out of $450.

Listen to your parents.  You also might be able to get something less expensive from ebay, craisglist, or a computer store that rebuilds older computers.</Content>

            <Content>the only ligit offers are those that tell you to complete their sponsors offers and you will get a laptop or xbox whatever . this does work . however you must complete so many offers which cost you money . nothing like that is free. you pay the sponsors and they pay advertising dollars to the site you went to and that pays for the product.</Content>
