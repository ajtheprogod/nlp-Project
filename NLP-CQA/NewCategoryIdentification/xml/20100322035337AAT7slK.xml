            <Content>WElcome to Pay Pal.  This is only the beginning of confusion and strange e-mails.  Many will be scams not at all from Pay Pal. DO NOT click or agree to anything without contacting Pay Pal first to see if the e-mail is valid.

This e-mail is saying that you have made a purchase which will appear on your bank statement. Did you make a purchase?</Content>
