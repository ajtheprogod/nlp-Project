  <Question id="20100318115139AAb6Awl" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Looking for members! Yes YOU!?</Subject>
    <Content>Hello!

I have a brand new forum out and I&#039;m looking to gain some members who would love to chat and get to know people within a community. We are not expecting the forum to get a very large community, but we are hoping each and every one of you who read this would at least stop by and see if there are category&#039;s that would interest you! Look forward to seeing you!
