  <Question id="20100306034739AAYle9I" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Why do most of the FML stories sound fake?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m talking about fmylife.com, for the record. It&#039;s supposed to have true stories of people&#039;s really bad days. Not only are most of them unbelievable, but the mostly follow the same formulas, like

&quot;Today, my boyfriend thought it would be funny to stab me several times. FML&quot;

and 

&quot;Today, my dog relieved himself on my head just as I was leaving the house for my first day working for a Fortune 500 company. There are no showers on the way to work. FML.&quot;

I wonder how many real life, less dramatic stories are rejected to publish that kind of stuff on the website.

        <Answer>
            <Content>Why? Because it makes it more entertaining, but most of them are too obviously fake and works the other way instead.

My advice? Don&#039;t bother with it.</Content>

            <Content>Today, I was supposed to go on a date with a guy I really like. My friends convinced me that he was going to stand me up and that I should just stay home to avoid being hurt. He showed up; I didn&#039;t. My friends laughed at my gullible nature. FML

Today, I walked into Mcdonalds to get a meal. I saw the donation box and felt generous so put some money in. Instead of putting a $5 note I put a $100 note. I asked if they could open it to get it back. They didn&#039;t have a key. FML

Non-dramatic stories would inevitably be rejected as being dull and of little interest</Content>

            <Content>I think that&#039;s why FML is so boring. I like ifmurdered way better. You&#039;re allowed to make things up because it&#039;s your wishes!</Content>
