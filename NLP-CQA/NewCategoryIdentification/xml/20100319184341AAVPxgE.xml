  <Question id="20100319184341AAVPxgE" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Proboards or Invisionfree?</Subject>
    <Content>I have used Proboards for a little over six years, and haven&#039;t really tried using invisionfree seriously, but which honestly is the better forum for an RPG?

I&#039;ve heard that proboards is generally better because it is safer and less buggy, but invisionfree wins a lot of votes because it has more coding functionality.

Which do you think is the better board regarding security and reliability? Please do not consider the coding bonuses/graphic add ons in the vote.

    <ChosenAnswer>I don&#039;t prefer either of them to be honest. I&#039;d go with http://www.forumotion.com

- Proboards are easily hacked, prone to spam bots, etc.
- Invisionfree is a little better, though now more prone to bots and spam then ever. Also run a bit slow and have a shitty ACP.</ChosenAnswer>
