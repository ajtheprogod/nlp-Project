    <ChosenAnswer>yes you entered into a contract to buy although not much can be done other than a threat to close your account.It has happened to me as a seller and it is not worth the hassle chasing the money just easier to re-list it.Hope this helps.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>contact the seller and ask them to open a dispute, (sounds bad, but it isnt) this then allows both parties to withdraw from the sale. 

Doing it this way, the seller gets back his listing fee and final valuation fee from ebay. Otherwise the buyer is charged by ebay, even if you dont pay.

As a Seller, I have had this happen a few times and its quick and painless for both parties, he can then relist the item (or offer it to the next highest bidder).

Once done, leave nice feedback, as he has done you a favor.</Content>
