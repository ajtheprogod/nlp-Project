  <Question id="20100222221717AAXIMp7" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Internet Keeps Freezing on Mac?</Subject>
    <Content>This started happening a few days ago. When I try to go onto most sites, like Youtube, Collegehumor, Ultimate Guitar, and whatnot, it automatically goes to &#039;Not Responding&#039; right when the front page loads. On others, it just randomly occurs throughout the site. I tried reinstalling Firefox, but that didn&#039;t solve the problem. I am on the current edition of everything, and it was working perfectly fine a week ago. I am using high speed internet via ethernet cable, but also use the airport/wireless internet off the router. No other computers are using the router at the same time, and barely have used any memory. Thanks for any help.

            <Content>The Windows operating system constantly refers to the registry to get information about all of the components such as hardware and software which are installed on the computer. The registry tells Windows what to do and how to access the various programs, files, and processes.However, the registry can contain bad information which sends Windows off doing useless tasks or running unneeded routines. Sometimes errors occur including the freezeing. Other times the system slows down. Because of the sheer number of factors that can affect the registry, there’s no one size fits all approach. You can’t just go into the registry and remove the bad information because it’s nearly impossible to decipher which information is good and which information is bad. That’s a job better suited for software. I should like to commend Registry Easy http://computer-e-book-money.com            to you ! You can try ! Good luck!</Content>
