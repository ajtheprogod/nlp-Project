    <ChosenAnswer>To discover if the recipient has received and read your mail, you can &#039;tick&#039; the &#039;Return Receipt&#039; and &#039;Read Reciept&#039; options offered by most mail &#039;send&#039; packages .. however the recipient can use their own mail package &#039;privacy&#039; settings to ignore such requests ..

If you have the slightest reason to suspect that some-one else has access to your email account, CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD NOW ...

Most email packages automatically mark messages as &#039;read&#039; when you open then, HOWEVER it is quite possible to manually mark them &#039;unread&#039; again ..

By far the best solution is to download messages onto your own PC (by using a mail package such as Mozilla Thunderbird) .. this way you mail is NOT left &#039;on-line&#039; at the mail service provider ... anyone getting access to your on-line mail would then see only your very latest new mail, not any of your old mail (or copies of yours sent mail .. .. ..)</ChosenAnswer>
