            <Content>Anything on ebay is paid through paypal, unless seller will allow a credit/debit card for purchase. I tried myself to uncommitt at one point but never was able too. Try contacting ebay personally and ask them to remove it.</Content>

            <Content>There is no &quot;accident&quot;.  If you bid on an item, you committed to buying that item.  Always read the listing entirely and understand its contents before you bid.  

If you do not complete the transaction, the seller will still be charged fees as if the item was sold.  That&#039;s not fair to the seller.

If you want the item, sign up for Paypal.  It&#039;s easy, free to use as a buyer, and with a credit card your purchases are protected.

If you do not want the item, contact the seller.  Let them know you made a mistake.  See what they say.  Chances are, they will not be pleased with you.

No, you won&#039;t go to jail for this.</Content>
