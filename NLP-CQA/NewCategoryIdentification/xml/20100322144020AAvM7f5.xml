    <ChosenAnswer>I used Reg123 for my web site, i got a .co.uk name for 2 years for about £11.00 + vat. I also got a .com name too for a little bit more, £20 approx but for 1yr. Both have recently been renewed without any problems.  
I lot of the sites will offer you the www. name you want, but its the cost.
Good Luck</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>well your best typing in domain names into google.
the prices are all pretty much the same
just look for one that seems to have good bandwidth.
just needs a little googling on your part as prices and bandwidth provided changes all the time

            <Content>As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. A domain name is a name you want to call your website (ex: www.yahoo.com). To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I’m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting &amp; I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them. 

You can reach reviews about this web hosting provider and its latest DISCOUNT COUPONS at:

They also offer &quot;Free Site Builder&quot; that helps you build your web pages without difficulty if you are not skilled in using any website creating program (WYSIWYG: What You See Is What You Get). You can use this service optionally. You can also create the pages offline with your favorite program (DreamWeaver, FrontPage, Microsoft Publisher, iWeb etc.), and then upload them to your web host. This is another easy way to get your website online.

******IMPORTANT********
