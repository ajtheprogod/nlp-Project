    <ChosenAnswer>You need to make a little mind switch first: from &quot;employee&quot; mentality to &quot;self employed&quot; mentality.
It might even take you 5 years to make this tiny switch but unless you make it, you will never find any &quot;legitimate online job&quot;.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>What is your first sense when you meet some program that promise you to give money just for joining with no other efforts? &quot;It is too good to be true&quot; - is that? In prevalence it IS too good to be true.
The Internet is overload with all kinds of on-line business stuff. There are many usable programs either. But as far as I know by experience there aren&#039;t way to earn money without investing your efforts. Firstly you must learn a lot to succeed in that field. Secondly you must implement what you learn. Without these main things every program that you join will seem scam.</Content>
