    <Subject>Where do emails go after you permanently delete them?</Subject>
    <Content>Been wondering this for a while. Do they still exist somewhere? When you delete them, where do they go? They don&#039;t get stored in your computer; they have to go to some place online don&#039;t they? Thanks ;)

    <ChosenAnswer>Yes. When you delete them off of your computer, they are only removed from the filesystem index. This means that through an undeleter application, any and all emails/files can be restored. Over time though, these deleted files are overwritten with new files.

Online though, deleted emails could be stored on some server, somewhere... basically forever. They are only deleted from your inbox. Remember, on the internet, nothing is truly safe.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>They get deleted.  However, if the email provider you use does caching (server wide copy just incase of a catastrophic server failure where they need to restore it to a previous point), it&#039;s possible for them to exist until their cache expires.  I don&#039;t think any email provider reveals how long the cache is kept.  But don&#039;t worry, no-one can see them unless they have access to the server itself.</Content>

            <Content>the government stores them in a file they keep on you . 

really , by default they are sent to the trash folder in your email client . Unless you check in the options for them not to be sent there. You can also have them deleted from the trash folder when you shut down the email client . you can also right click on the trash folder and click Empty Trash . They are gone .
 They are like any other data on your hard drive . they just get written over when you delete them permanently . If your email client is set to leave a copy on the server than there will be on there. 
this all assumes that you are downloading your email to your pc . If you are using web based email like yahoo then it is on their server and the same all applies except it is not on your drive.</Content>
