  <Question id="20100225185003AAUbLus" type="Answered">
    <Subject>My internet connection is fine, but for some reason I can&#039;t access the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>About a month ago, one day I clicked on my Internet, and the page said that it could not be accessed. I&#039;m a little confused, because the internet symbol says it is fine, and on all the other accounts on this computer, (like the one I&#039;m using now) the Internet loads perfectly. 
I&#039;ve tried everything. Does anyone know what&#039;s going on, and how I can fix it? 
Thanks, it&#039;s driving me crazy!
