    <ChosenAnswer>This might help. Go the website below, Download Ccleaner. (Make sure you click &quot;Download Latest Version&quot;)

http://www.filehippo.com/download_ccleaner

Once it&#039;s finished downloading, open it up and once Ccleaner has opened. Click &quot;Analyze&quot; and when it&#039;s analyzed everything click &quot;Run Cleaner&quot;. This should only take a second to scan since it only erases your internet cache etc.

Next, click on &quot;Registry&quot;. Then click &quot;Scan for Issues&quot;. Once scan has finished, click &quot;Fix seleted Issues&quot; (don&#039;t back files up) and then click &quot;Fix all&quot;

Now, try opening firefox or internet explorer. It should help start it. Before opening Ccleaner make sure you exit your current web browse so it can scan that.

I hope this work.
