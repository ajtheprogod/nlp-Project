  <Question id="20100223142956AAPIQo3" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I get my own &#039;.com&#039; website without spending much money?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m trying to set up a non-profit website and I&#039;ve been looking up domains and things like that but most of it seems like it&#039;s going to cost about $10 a month or more. I don&#039;t really want to spend $100 a year on this website, although it is important to me to start it. Any advice?

            <Content>You get what you pay for.

To have your own domain inside .com or .org, you have to pay a registration fee. These are typically around $15/year and you can&#039;t get around them. This reserves the name for your use but doesn&#039;t supply anything to actually do anything with it.

GoDaddy offers hosting for as little as $5/month, see my first link. With registration, that would cost you about $72 for a year.

Another possibility is to start out with free hosting without your own domain name and then use a domain registrar who provides free URL redirection (second link). The way this works is as follows:

1) You register for a free web site at any service you like. (Search for &#039;free web hosting&#039;.) Note that most of these are ad supported.

2) You get the URL for your web site, it will be something like http://www.somehostingcomapny.com/mywebsitename/

3) You then register for a .com or .org address with a provider that offers URL redirection and configure their redirection service to redirect http://www.yourwebsitenet.com/ to http://www.somehostingcomapny.com/mywebsitename/

This will allow people to get to your web site by entering your domain name, although their address bar will immediately change to the longer, uglier address.

You can upgrade to paid hosting later, and people will still be able to find your site assuming they didn&#039;t bookmark the inside pages.

This will get your cost down to $15/year. But the huge downside is that any links inside your web site that become popular will be lost if you move to paid hosting.</Content>
