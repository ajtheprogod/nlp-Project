  <Question id="20100316151735AA5VUZk" type="Answered">
    <Subject>On Gaiaonline, my avatar, nor my friend&#039;s avatar show up and I can&#039;t log in. What&#039;s wrong?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;ve tried, and I&#039;ve used my password and tried to retrieve the password, yet nothing works. Gaia says that my e-mail isn&#039;t in the database, but when I tried using it for a new account, it said that my e-mail was already in use. It won&#039;t show many of my friends&#039; avatars, and mine won&#039;t show up. My profile also change, reverted to its standard look. I really hate this, and I think I&#039;ve been hacked. Has this happen before? Is this normal? Is there a way to fix this problem? 
This is my profile: http://gaiaonline.com/profiles/8636333
