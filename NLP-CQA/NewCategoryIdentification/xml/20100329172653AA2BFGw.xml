    <ChosenAnswer>4chan is oft regarded as being the scum of the Internet. It&#039;s one of what&#039;s called an &quot;image board&quot;, that includes many people having conversations based on images. Every conversation begins with an image, and people talk about it. Usually the images are crude or even illegal. It&#039;s hard to keep track of who&#039;s who, because everyone just called themselves &quot;anonymous&quot;. It&#039;s separated up into difference categories, each of which is identified by a letter. You should particularly avoid /b/.

            <Content>I&#039;d stay away from it if I were you. It&#039;s full of free speech, which includes lots of hate speech and shocking images. Normally has pictures of adult content too. It can be humourous, but it&#039;s just very strange. It is, however, highly addictive, so I&#039;d recommend not starting it. If you&#039;d just want the funny pictures they make, then some can be found on www.twobluecrabs.com, but again beware of hate speech.</Content>
