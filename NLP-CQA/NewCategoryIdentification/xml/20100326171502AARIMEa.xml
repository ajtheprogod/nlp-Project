  <Question id="20100326171502AARIMEa" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What&#039;s the best way of selling my music on the internet?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m not interested in letting Apple take a large share of money from my hard work. If my myspace, facebook and twitter pages are the hub of peoples&#039; knowledge of my music is there anyway I can set up my own Paypal link for them to purchase the mp3s from a private server or somewhere else without losing a considerable deal of the money? 

I know it seems greedy but I think Apple and many other sellers are worse for their percentage takings.

            <Reference>Lady Gaga- Her music sucks, but its just her fashion and the way she looks that&#039;s gotten her famous. (As well as the whole hermaphrodite conspiracy about her...)  
As well as many other artists.</Reference>
