    <ChosenAnswer>First of all, people can&#039;t get your IP off of Omegle.

Secondly, you have no profile, they don&#039;t know whether you are a guy or a girl, 10 or 70.  

Thirdly, dateline NBC doesn&#039;t use Omegle to hunt down predators.

Fourthly, Chris Hansen is only the host, he doesn&#039;t do any of the actually chatting.

So don&#039;t worry, your &#039;friend&#039; isn&#039;t in any real trouble, it was just someone messing around with you.  In fact I tell people to &quot;Have a seat over here&quot; when ever they try to start up that kind of chat with me, just to screw with their minds and let them know I&#039;m not interested.  Though keep this in mind and learn from it.  That is really not the kind of behaviour you want to be participating in because it could get you into real trouble in the future.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>i have no idea what omegle is, but its defiantly possible to locate someone through their IP address. However, ussually when your surfing the web you will have an IP mask, which blocks your true identity.

not only that, but if you have someones IP, then a savvy hacker can gain access to your computer. I&#039;ve done that multiple times before; its quite funny hijacking your friends computer...</Content>

            <Content>It sucks to be you right now!
If I were you, I would call NBC and tell them that you were simply joking around. 
Otherwise, you could be in serious trouble</Content>
