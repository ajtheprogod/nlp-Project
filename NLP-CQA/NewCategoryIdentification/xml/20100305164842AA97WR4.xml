    <ChosenAnswer>If you live in an isolated area and you&#039;re after internet then you&#039;ll probabaly need to get satellite broadband. There are a number of providers which you should be able to find in your local phone book. Testra Next G phones usually only work if you&#039;re not too far out of a town.</ChosenAnswer>
