    <ChosenAnswer>All three are great. The people who are only saying one over the other are just fanboys that don&#039;t know what is going on behind the scenes. They just probably have read some review that said one is faster. Other people choose not to use chrome because of googles information gatering and sharing habits.

I believe ALL people should have MORE than one browser on their system. One acts as a safety net for the other. I recommend trying each and seeing how each renders your page. You will find they are different even though the code they are displaying is the same. ALSO some web pages may not work in full function or may require plug ins. Try several, keep at least two

You can use all three on your computer. PLUS there are TONS more browsers.</ChosenAnswer>
