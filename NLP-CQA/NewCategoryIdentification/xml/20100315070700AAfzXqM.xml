            <Content>You won&#039;t find any useful discussion forums and, more and more, you won&#039;t find any useful job fairs (they&#039;re turning into places that companies use to advertise their &quot;we&#039;ll show you how to find a job if you pay us, no guarantee, though&quot; products).  Post resumes on Monster, careers.com and places like that, network (if the company that a friend works for suddenly has an opening, you&#039;ll be among the first to know), knock on doors asking if there are any openings in what you do, etc.  Sitting at the computer almost never results in a job.  (Thousands of people apply for every opening on job boards - only one gets the job.  But posting is free, so post.)</Content>
