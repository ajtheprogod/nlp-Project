    <ChosenAnswer>Most &quot;scams&quot; involve fake emails sent to you directly that appear to be from genuine Ebay members but are in fact not.  Always check your &quot;my messages&quot; inbox on Ebay if in doubt. If the message is not in there then it was not sent via Ebay and is spam and you should either delete it or  forward it to www.ebay.com as spam. 

You have to use your judgement, if an item seems to be too good to be true it probably is. Read the description carefully and double check the postage rates. I buy and sell regularly from abroad, that is not usually a problem as long as the postage is stated. If not messge the seller and ask before you bid/buy, too late afterwards if you discover the postage is extortionate. 

Unless someone has 100% feedback I physically read all the negative/neutral comments (you can click on the number beside negative you don&#039;t have to trawl through hundreds of comments).  Someone who sells thousands of items per month can have a high feedback score and still have 8 or 10 negative feedback comments each month so I steer well clear of anyone with less than 99% feedback.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Look at the seller&#039;s Feedback (record), see what other people said about their purchases and have they been in business for long. 
Better to stick to things within your own country.</Content>
