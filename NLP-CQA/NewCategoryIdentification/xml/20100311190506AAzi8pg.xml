  <Question id="20100311190506AAzi8pg" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I can&#039;t load videos from JW Player and a few others?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m very frustrated because I am watching Fairy Tail and I use the JW Player from OnePieceOfBleach website.
Now, suddenly, I can&#039;t load the video. It&#039;s not white screen or anything. It&#039;s fine but when i press play it goes the usual buffering but it won&#039;t start at all.
I&#039;ve tried with all my browsers, Opera, Google Chrome, Firefox, and IE.
So can someone help me a little, pretty please??
