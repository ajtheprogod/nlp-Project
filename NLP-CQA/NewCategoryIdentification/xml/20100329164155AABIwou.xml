    <Subject>LiveJournal: What&#039;s the difference between joining a community and watching a community?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m pretty new to LiveJournal and I&#039;m just wondering what the difference is between joining a community and simply watching it? Do you have to be active in the community for a while before joining it? Thanks in anticipation =]

    <ChosenAnswer>I&#039;m not absolutely sure; but if you can now watch(?), it would seem you don&#039;t have to join.  By being active if you mean to &quot;post&quot; on it, I would certainly think it mandatory that you join.

     I use to be a member of several Yahoo Groups; but ultimately withdrew from them all.  The only one I found really interesting, I can still read all the latest postings; but not post anything myself(really don&#039;t want to).

     Probably not much of an answer; but have starred your question,
