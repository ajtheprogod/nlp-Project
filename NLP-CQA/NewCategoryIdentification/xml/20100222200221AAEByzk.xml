    <Subject>I need a good media player for website!?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay so I recently bought a domain and am hosting it this week. It is a website used for a home filming company called Konnection Films and what I am looking for is a nice media player that I can use for my videos. I don&#039;t want Youtube crap I am looking for something like Hulu, or Crackle. I want a darker skin with user friendly settings. Preferably if I can get the source of hulu&#039;s media player to play on my website that would be the best. Hopefully you get the right idea of what I want. Hope for responds! Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>Personally, I use Moyea Web Player to stream video on my website. 
Moyea Web Player ( http://www.playerdiy.com/ ) is a quick solution to add flash video ( FLV ) to website and an easy-to-use Web FLV player creator, with which, creating custom FLV player (flash video player) with scrollable thumbnail playlist for website only needs a few mouse-clicks. And the skin of the generated web player can be easily customized.

This is an example for easily customizing the flash video player -

            <Content>Good media players are:

jwplayer
proplayer

the above store the video files on the server, and need to be installed on the server.

a google search will give you more options

if you aren&#039;t interested in using up the bandwidth of your server you can use an external host like megavideo, veoh, google video, etc.

if your patient you can wait for html 5 to be implemented and then you won&#039;t need a player.</Content>
