    <Subject>Netflix Problem--Help!?</Subject>
    <Content>When I try to watch a Netflix &quot;Watch Instantly&quot; Movie on the computer, it works well for about 5 seconds, but then it quits and a message pops up: &quot;Media Playback Error/ Error Code: 
N8156-4001/ We were unable to load this title for playback.&quot; etc. Here&#039;s the thing--I have used Netflix&#039; instant streaming service for over 2 months and have never had a problem like this before. The day before this happened I watched a movie that was two hours and ten minutes long. The next day I tried to watch a two hour movie, and this happened for the first time. Now every single movie I try to watch, even a 20 minute TV episode, this same thing happens. Has anyone had a problem like this? How did they fix it? And please don&#039;t suggest calling customer service--already tried it and they said it was my internet connection which makes no sense at all.
