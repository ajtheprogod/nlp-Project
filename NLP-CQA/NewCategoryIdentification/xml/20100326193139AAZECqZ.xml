    <ChosenAnswer>You could setup a blog or website, this is completely free. Once you have added some good content, you can start to earn money from advertising. I know you wont make a huge income from this, but it would get you started working from home.

Pick a topic which you are very interested in, and write a piece on that everyday.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Yes if you know how to use Remote desktop to login to your work PC at home or you can buy the same software you use for your work PC and install it on your home PC then send the work files to your boss when done.

If you enter data into a website with a web browser, then you can work at home. You just need the web address, password, and username.</Content>
