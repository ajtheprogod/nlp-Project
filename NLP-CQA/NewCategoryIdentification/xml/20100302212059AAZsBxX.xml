    <Subject>Aim people &quot;logged off under a minute ago&quot;?</Subject>
    <Content>As soon as i go on aim it always lists a handful of my buddies as &quot;logging off under a minute ago&quot; but i know people arent logging off simultaneously as soon as i get on (if they did they would have just blocked me). any idea what causes it or how to get it to stop, i would like to get an accurate gauge on when people get off aim if thats possible
