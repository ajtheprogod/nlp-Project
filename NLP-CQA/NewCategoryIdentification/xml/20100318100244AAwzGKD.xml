    <Subject>reselling items on ebay that I purchased on ebay?</Subject>
    <Content>I purchased an item off of ebay and while it is accurate, it is too big.  How do I use the pictue from the seller&#039;s original listing?  I still see it in &#039;My Won&#039; listing but can&#039;t seem to copy the picture.
Does the seller own the rights to the picture and I have to take a new one?  I have a couple items that I want to resell and it would simply be easier to use the same pictures.

    <ChosenAnswer>Its a big no no to pinch the sellers photo (and/or description), and if reported your auction will be taken down almost immediately, and you will get a slap and restrictions on your account.
Either don&#039;t be so lazy and take your own photo, or ask the Seller for his permission</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>First, I would ask the original seller if it&#039;s okay.

Then, either ask them to send you the files, or right-click on the pictures on the site and save them to your local drive. Then re-upload them to the seller page when you create it.

If you can&#039;t do this, time to get the camera out.</Content>

            <Content>technically they do have rights to the picture, but i dont think most people really care. you cant right click and copy it but one way to copy it is to open the picture then click &quot;print screen&quot; on your keyboard. Open up paint now and just paste it and cut the picture out and save it and now u have the picture.</Content>
