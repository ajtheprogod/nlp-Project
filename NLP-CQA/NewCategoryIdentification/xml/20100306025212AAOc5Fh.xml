    <ChosenAnswer>There is nothing wrong with your router and you can change security settings from WPA to WEP. 
I think ( Wi-Fi Protected Access) WPA2-PSK is default security setting in your d-link router,check through the SET UP configuration in your router and change security from WPA2 to WEP.

have a nice time.</ChosenAnswer>
