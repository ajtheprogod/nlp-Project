    <Subject>Slow internet due to virus?</Subject>
    <Content>My internet for the last week or so has been running very slow.
When i first connect to the internet and quickly run a speed test my connect is about 2MB,
But then after about 3mins of being connected its just says on 24kbps :L,
This never used to happen, but i have also started to get A LOT of pops up with news tabs opening randomly to gambling sites or some weird search engines. 
I ran avast computer scan and removed the infected files but it is still running at 24kbps :L.
What can i do?
