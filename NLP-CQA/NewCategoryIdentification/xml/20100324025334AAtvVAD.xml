            <Content>Yes I usually clean out my Temp files because I can get up to 8,000 items a day because I trundle around quite a bit, but I don&#039;t bother with cookies or anything else.

Mainly because they contain the details to activate your auto log in details on sites. If you delete them you have to start all over again and I&#039;m lazy because I like an easy life. Anyway seeing I&#039;m the only one who uses this computer it doesn&#039;t matter that much to me.

The average one is about 200 bytes and they automatically update every time you visit the site.

I haven&#039;t cleaned mine out in over 18 months and I&#039;ve just checked and I have only got 3.654 taking up the grand total of 2.15 MB on a 160 GB drive!</Content>
