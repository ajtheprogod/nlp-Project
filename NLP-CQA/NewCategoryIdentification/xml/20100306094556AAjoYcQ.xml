  <Question id="20100306094556AAjoYcQ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does Formspring ever take a while to publish your answers?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m on Formspring and I just answered like four questions, and then they disappeared. They didn&#039;t show up on my profile, answered, and they&#039;re not in my inbox anymore. I clicked &quot;Respond&quot; then I answered then I clicked &quot;Save&quot; and they dissolved and it went back to my inbox, like normal, and now they&#039;re not there. Does it sometimes take a while?

    <ChosenAnswer>The same thing happened to me too!!

I think it&#039;s just today, because there are others who are having the same problem...a few of my friends are, plus there is another person on Answers who asked the same question, and a few answered back with the same problem. Looks like it could be just a glitch in the system, since it seemed to be having a couple problems yesterday. It won&#039;t post my answers on Facebook either, so it&#039;s Formspring&#039;s site that&#039;s having the problems. 

 I think it might just be backed up, so the answers should be coming up in a few hours or so.</ChosenAnswer>
