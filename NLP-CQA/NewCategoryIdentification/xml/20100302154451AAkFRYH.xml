    <Subject>Why can&#039;t I right click on anything in firefox?</Subject>
    <Content>Okay, so I can right click just fine on my desktop, (like to open the internet of change my settings) but i can&#039;t on fire fox. I&#039;ve already downloaded the new version of it and checked everything I know to check to figure out my problem but nothing works. It&#039;s not just pictures but text too! When I try to right click the little menu that shows copy, paste, save, etc. doesn&#039;t even appear. Absolutely nothing happens. I&#039;ve tried just about every combination of keys I know to bypass this, even tried to copy the whole page. but still nothing happens. It&#039;s not just one web page either, It&#039;s every single page... is anyone out there able to help? please?

            <Content>Firefox is a stuck-up bitch, don&#039;t worry though, Google Chrome is a great guy and loves to party, so ditch Firefox, Chrome is your new best friend!</Content>

            <Content>Try clearing your history and cookies. Also with the new version of firefox it has been reported that yahoo toolbar may cause this so if you have it i would try uninstalling yahoo toolbar. After doing this restart firefox and see if it worked. If it doesn&#039;t im not sure.</Content>

            <Content>1) Chrome isn&#039;t that great.
2) Close firefox (don&#039;t save your tabs) and make sure that it&#039;s not in your processes (ALT+CTRL+DELETE) 
3) Reopen firefox and if the problem is still there then you must reinstall firefox. 
4) Start - Control Panel - Add/Remove Programs - Mozilla Firefox - Remove
5) Using IE reinstall it and if that STILL doesn&#039;t fix your problem then....
6) Use crappy ol&#039; IE or lame ol&#039; Goggle Chrome 

If you enjoy all the features Firefox gives you then Chrome will not make you a happy customer. Just contact mozilla about your problem. You also may be able to find a someone that had this problem and fixed it in Mozilla&#039;s forums... Check that out too.</Content>
