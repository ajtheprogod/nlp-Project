    <ChosenAnswer>You should have received a cd with your Home Hub which shows you what and how you connect. It also installs BT Yahoo for internet access. If you went through the whole procedure as instructed on the cd, give BT Broadband support a call. It&#039;s Freephone and they are very helpful and will talk you through the problem.</ChosenAnswer>
