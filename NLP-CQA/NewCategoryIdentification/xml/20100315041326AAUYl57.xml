  <Question id="20100315041326AAUYl57" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I think I am being scammed on E-bay?</Subject>
    <Content>I won a low-value item on Friday night and was planning to go and pay for it by pay-pal yesterday but I found the below message from the seller (I have blanked out their address).  As it was requesting my e-mail address I reported it as that is not allowed by Ebay.  I do not know what the form is they are talking about and why would I send a duplicate payment; and they didn;t even seem to notice that I hadn&#039;t yet paid (it would come up as item paid for on Ebay).  I will not give them my address and it looks dodgy so I am wary of continuing with the transaction even in the normal way but I don;t want any negative feedback.  I have contacted Ebay and have no reply.  What would you do?  

&quot;Hi, I changed my emil address last week so this payment hasn&#039;t gone through as my old email was hacked into and this is where the payment has gone. Please could you send me your email address so I can send you a money request form? or if you could pay to email address ************@googlemail.com

Kind regards&quot;

    <ChosenAnswer>It may not be a scam,I had a similar problem a couple of weeks ago (as a seller)
For some reason paypal had an old email address of mine and tried to collect the payment into that.
I had to go into paypal and change back to my new email address.
It wasn`t an easy process to complete, and your seller could have got confused with the instructions.
I had to contact the buyer and ask them to repay into the new email address.

Have you looked at the sellers feedback?
If they have plenty of good feedback, it`s very unlikely to be a scam.

Have a look in your &quot;won items&quot;
You will probably find that your payment is still pending. (A little egg timer at the side of it)
They won`t have been able to take it, as the wrong email address has been used.

Can`t understand why they`re asking for your email address though, but like I said they may be confused as to how to sort it out.
I had to contact paypal for instructions, but it was easier for me as my old email address was still active and I was somehow (can`t remember how) able to do it from there.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Actually you can pay someone through a email address but the thing is it wont be linked to your item on ebay.  The money request form is like a invoice that the seller can send you via  paypal. However, I dont blame you for being cautious even though its a low value item.(its better to be safe then sorry if you know what I mean)
It is possible they have had their account hacked &amp; paypal  has limited their account. Contact ebays live chat &amp; ask what the best course of action is.

BTW - Sellers cant leave buyers negative feedback anymore</Content>
