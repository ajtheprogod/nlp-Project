    <ChosenAnswer>If you are a member on Club Penguin and that Membership runs out, you will not lose all your items completely. Your member clothes will fade on your inventory but you will still be able to see them but won&#039;t be able to use them. You will only be able to use your NON member items.

As for your igloo, when your Membership runs out, when you visit your igloo a message will pop up and show you a picture of your Member igloo and it says something like &#039;Your igloo will be saved and when you become a member again, your igloo will be just like this&#039;.

I can assure that you WON&#039;T lose ANY of your items/furniture or coins, ect.

Good Luck, and rate best answer if this helped.</ChosenAnswer>
