    <ChosenAnswer>1. Go to the orkut sign-in page. 
2. Click the I cannot access my account link. 
3. Follow the instructions for submitting your email address. For security purposes, the email address you enter needs to be your primary email address or the email address you use to sign in to orkut. 

As I&#039;m aware, they just use your google account to access orkut. It&#039;s your gmail/google username and password.
