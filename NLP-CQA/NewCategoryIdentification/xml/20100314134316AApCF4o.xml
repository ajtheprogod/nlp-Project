  <Question id="20100314134316AApCF4o" type="Answered">
    <Subject>why can&#039;t I load some sites?! 5 stars asap today!?</Subject>
    <Content>So I have the crappy Verizon DSL connection. It&#039;s raining in my area but I asked my neighbor friends if their DSL works and they said theirs was fine.

Some sites won&#039;t load for me like Yahoo! mail, Twitter, etc. Facebook, my search engine, and other sites works for me though. Its like 50% working, the other 50% doesn&#039;t. AIM works fine.

what is wrong?
I scanned my PC for viruses, there&#039;s nothing wrong.
I tested my connection, it seems fine.

I am using windows XP, using mozilla firefox. I tested windows IE and it doesn&#039;t load the same pages either. I cleared cookies, cache, etc. My firewall is on. I turned it off to see if anything changes, nothing did.

is my computer the problem, or my internet?

    <ChosenAnswer>Sometimes it appears that acomputer will especially act up in the rain. I have found that you can reset the Network.
Shut your computer clear OFF
Pull the power adapter from both the MODEM and the ROUTER.
Wait like 5 minutes and then Plug in the Modem and wait at least 1 minute.
Now Plug in the ROUTER and wait 1 minute.
Now you can restart your computer. Be sure you let the computer boot all the way up and now give it a whirl.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>I would recommend you to call verizon because the problem may be with the service, it looks like its disconnecting you from the internet, they have a couple tests that can determine if you are getting a stable connection.</Content>
