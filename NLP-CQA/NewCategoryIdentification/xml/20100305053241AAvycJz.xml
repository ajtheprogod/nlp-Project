    <Subject>Why do domain names cost money? Do they REALLY have to be managed by FOR-PROFIT organizations?</Subject>

EDIT: &quot;Impossible&quot;? Why exactly can&#039;t a non-for-profit like Wikimedia do it?

    <ChosenAnswer>If there was no regularization of the issue and registration of domain names, the Internet would be in total chaos.  It costs money to register a domain name with the appropriate authorities, and it costs money to maintain the service offered by the domain name provider.
You may think the Internet is a magical free place, but there are actual people behind every website, and in the case of websites providing some sort of service, these people are actual workers who actually want paying.</ChosenAnswer>
