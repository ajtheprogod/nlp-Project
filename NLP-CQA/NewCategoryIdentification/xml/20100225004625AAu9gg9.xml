  <Question id="20100225004625AAu9gg9" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How in the world do I join restricted Roleplays on Second Life?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m old enough to join these. I promise to obey their rules....but every time I try to teleport there, it says I&#039;m not allowed.

The two roleplays I&#039;m talking about are Nomos and Malka City. 

So...how can I join these if I&#039;m not allowed to teleport there? Lots of other people play....what&#039;s the secret? Please, give me suggestions on how to join, begging you....

    <ChosenAnswer>We are currently setting up a new game at Nomos, so it is closed to the public.
That is why you cannot teleport here at the moment.

You are welcome to check out our website http://www.socionex.com to find out more about it.
We hope to be able to open the SIM sometime next week.

If you are in the Nomos group, you will get a notice when the SIM is open ... or try to teleport next week... 

Good luck :)
