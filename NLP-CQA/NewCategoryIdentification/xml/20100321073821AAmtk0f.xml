  <Question id="20100321073821AAmtk0f" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do you download photos from a particular album on multiply.com?</Subject>
    <Content>I can&#039;t remember that program which I used before in downloading photos from a particular album from multiply.com. It has a very user friendly interface in which you only have to input either the album name, the tags, or simply the name of the owner of that particular multiply site. You have to click a button to start the download. Please help me. The album which I intend to download is open for viewing to everyone. I am just quite lazy to download all of the photos. Should you want to add programs you are using to download a batch of photos, please do add, as this would be very greatly appreciated. Just make sure, the program/s is/are safe to use and is/are safe on vista. Thanks =)
