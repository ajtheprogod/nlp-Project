    <Subject>Lockerz points generator/hack question?</Subject>
    <Content>I just joined lockerz because my friend won $5000 worth of electronics, but the day I joined, all of the prize costs went up really high. I found out about the &quot;lockerz point generators,&quot; and was going to try it, but haven&#039;t found the time to yet.

I was just wondering if anyone has tried any of them and whether they work or not. I dont care if i get banned, all I want is a quick 1 time (1 day) point boost, cash my prizes and run.

If anyone has found another successful way of &quot;boosting lockerz points,&quot; then that would also be greatly appreciated.

Also, I know that this is frowned upon, so please don&#039;t leave bad remarks in the answers. All I want is what everyone else wants, lost of points fast.

Thanks for all of your answers!
