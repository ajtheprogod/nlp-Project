    <ChosenAnswer>If you created your blog on one of the big ones like blogspot or wordpress then you can&#039;t change the name because the subdomain is your name.  Why not just make 2 different blogs 1 for games and 1 for you since they are free.

But to name it, how about &quot;video game opinions you actually want to read&quot;? heheh</ChosenAnswer>
