    <ChosenAnswer>1st, you spell voting wrong... you said voteing.

2nd, Ahoy! Headquarters? Seriously?

3rd, Terms and conditions are simple... Make a new webpage, call it &quot;Terms and Conditons&quot; and put everything you can think of. As far as I know, its free to type.

You can use Weebly&#039;s terms of service as a template. http://www.weebly.com/tos.html</ChosenAnswer>
