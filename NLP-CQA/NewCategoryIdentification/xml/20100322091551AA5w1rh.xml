    <ChosenAnswer>Basically the error message is exactly right; your computer cannot reach the DNS server for some reason.  The DNS server is the Domain Name Server, it is in charge of converting your website names into IP addresses; such as google.com is actually 72.14.204.103 (it has multiple addresses).

## Troubleshooting Steps ##
Go to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network Connections &gt; right click on your &quot;Connected&quot; device &gt; select Repair or Fix or Renew
Try to surf, if it fails, continue.

Bring up a CMD prompt.   Go to Start &gt; Run &gt; type &quot;cmd&quot; &gt; hit &quot;enter&quot;, ok, or run.  Next type &quot;ipconfig /all&quot; and look for &quot;dns servers&quot;  If it&#039;s blank then you need to fill it in, if it has IPs then they could be wrong.
Type &quot;ipconfig /release&quot;
Type &quot;ipconfig /renew&quot;
If it&#039;s successful, try to get on the internet, if not continue.

Get the DNS server ip address from either a working computer or from your network administrator.  Once you get the IP address go to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network Connections &gt; right click on your &quot;Connected&quot; device &gt; Properties &gt; double click TCP/IP Settings (v4) &gt; then select &quot;Use the following DNS servers&quot; &gt; put in the addresses and hit Finish / ok.  
Try to get on the internet again; if unsuccessful, continue.

Type &quot;nslookup www.google.com&quot;
If it *doesn&#039;t* come up with an address, it&#039;s not something you can fix.  If it does, continue.
Type &quot;ping &lt;ip address&gt;&quot;
If it&#039;s successful then put that address in your web browser, if it works then it&#039;s a problem with the DNS server and it&#039;s outside your permissions to fix.</ChosenAnswer>
