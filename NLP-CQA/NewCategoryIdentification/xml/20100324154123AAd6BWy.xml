    <Content>Virus I think....help?
Every time I open up my computer, it says that Firefox isn&#039;t working 2 or 3 times. I know this isn&#039;t a problem with Firefox, because when I uninstalled it to see, it did the same thing with internet explorer. I think that it is a virus attempting to open up my browser but it fails. McAffee isn&#039;t picking up anything.

What is also strange is that when I tried to update firefox, it said that I couldn&#039;t because firefox was already running. I popped up task manager and closed the firefox.exe. Then it just popped up again. There were two explorer.exe&#039;s running, and one said *32 (32 bit). I guess I&#039;m lucky I have 64 bit or it would have gone undetected. I closed the explorer.exe*32 down, then firefox, and it didn&#039;t return.

Basically is this just a problem or a virus? If so, how do I fix it? As far as I can see, it isn&#039;t causing any real problems. It just says: &quot;Firefox has stopped working&quot; two or 3 times when I boot up but that&#039;s it.
I have no leads, because nothing is detecting anything. Maybe if I turned on DEP, it would stop...
What do you think?
