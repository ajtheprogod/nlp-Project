    <ChosenAnswer>No dear, 

its not the paper or magic that makes it work, its you, but at the same time the only thing standing in your way is you. I have alot to tell you and if you wanna know more how to make your wish come true please pm me... I have became a werewolf (well half...kind of) well not really a full werewolf but I have shifted a paw and thats enough to prove to me anythings possible.
