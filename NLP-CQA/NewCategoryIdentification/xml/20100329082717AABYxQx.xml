    <ChosenAnswer>If your user name is decided to be inappropriate by the Club Penguin Team, then your penguin name will remain being the P With the numbers after it. Since it takes them a while to review and they decide your user name is appropriate, it should change to your original user name that you typed in when creating this account in a few days.
