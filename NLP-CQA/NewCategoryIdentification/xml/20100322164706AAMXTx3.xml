  <Question id="20100322164706AAMXTx3" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How do I connect to the Internet.......?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a NETGEAR router for my laptop, and I accidentally disconnected it. Now when I try to reconnect it says I need a password.
I do not know the password. The Internet company didn&#039;t set it up, my dad did. 
Could I call the NETGEAR company and ask for the password or something?
What can I do?

Thanks!
