    <Subject>Stop Twitter Updates from Obama?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a T-Mobile phone and every time I go to a bigger city I get Twitter updates from Obama. I do not have a Twitter account, and I do not want to receive these updates. Is there any way to stop them from being sent to me? Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks.
Duh. 
I&#039;m not stupid, that has already occured to me. However, I live in a smal town which does not have much in the way of shopping and such, so I frequently visit the larger cities in order to obtain some neccesities that are not available to me at home. Now, this is not that big of a deal to me, although sometimes it ets annoying because it sends the same message over and over again. So, if there is a way to stop them, I would like to know. If not, I&#039;ll live.

    <ChosenAnswer>If you don&#039;t have a twitter account something is going wrong or someone has registered with your phone number. To stop the updates simply send this text message &#039;OFF &lt;TwitterUserName&gt;&#039; to 40404. In your case that would be &#039;OFF OBAMA&#039;.</ChosenAnswer>
