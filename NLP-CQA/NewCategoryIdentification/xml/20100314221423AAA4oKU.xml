            <Content>Hold it.  If you&#039;re setting up a paypal account for someone else that is overseas, then if that person commits fraud, you&#039;ll be on the hook for it.  First off, don&#039;t try to take anything out of it, and don&#039;t transfer any money from it or into it.  You may want to call paypal customer service and talk to them about it.  This is the kind of thing that can land you in lots of hot water.</Content>
