    <Subject>Where to Post a Pellet Gun for sale on Craigslist?</Subject>
    <Content>I have been trying to sell this pellet gun that I have on craigslist but every time I post it Craigslist deletes it. I was wondering if anyone knew on where I should post it. I have tried General and Sporting Goods.
I wrote .22 pellet rifle as the title but it still got deleted.

    <ChosenAnswer>Sporting goods sounds like it would be the right place to post.  Just make sure that the title is very clear in stating that it is a pellet gun and not a gun that uses bullets.</ChosenAnswer>
