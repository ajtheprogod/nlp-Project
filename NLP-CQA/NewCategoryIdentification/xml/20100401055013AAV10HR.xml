    <Subject>Why is this pesky ask.com site keep coming up?</Subject>
    <Content>I don&#039;t know why but there&#039;s a pesky site called ask.com that will take over my home page from time to time.

I thought I eliminated all trace of it from my computer using Revo Uninstaller.

    <ChosenAnswer>ask.com has a lot of programs they partner with to auto install their toolbars etc. when you download freeware/shareware. You can uninstall it usually through windows, but I would recommend running Malwarebytes anti malware (free AV program) just to be sure.</ChosenAnswer>
