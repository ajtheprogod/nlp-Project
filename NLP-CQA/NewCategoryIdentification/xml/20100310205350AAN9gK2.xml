    <Content>I&#039;m looking for something where you can chose what you want it to filter.
Most ones that I&#039;ve found are mostly for blocking out porn.

    <ChosenAnswer>I personally dont use blockers, however i have heard good things about;

1. Suricate
2. FoxFilter

I think in FoxFilter, you can choose to block keywords as well;  so they cant search it up in google. I installed them on several peoples computers, and they&#039;re happy with it so i dont know...

good luck! ;)</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Try Aobo Blocker. http://www.aobo-porn-filter.com
It is easy.You can add the websites and programs you don&#039;t want to blacklist. And it works in stealth mode, and won&#039;t show in the task manager. With password protection so that no one can change your settings without password.</Content>
