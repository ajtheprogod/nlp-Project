    <ChosenAnswer>They may ban and block you. But the worst thing they can due and is very rare is track your location via your IP address and report it to the police. Which may just end up in a warning or small fine. But it is very rare to ever get caught, so don&#039;t worry about it.</ChosenAnswer>
