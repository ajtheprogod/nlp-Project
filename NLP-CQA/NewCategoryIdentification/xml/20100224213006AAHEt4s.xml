OR:
Call 800 827-6364. Say: &quot;Cancellation.&quot; You&#039;ll need answer to your security question. Voice recognition not bad.

Then a live attendant. They ask why you&#039;re cancelling the service. Just repeat: I didn&#039;t like it. I didn&#039;t like it. Don&#039;t be any more specific, or they&#039;ll go off into a tree.

Then they&#039;ll ask, are you planning to go on highspeed? Do you want high-speed? 

No. No. No. No thank you. No thank you. Just repeat. You&#039;ll have to do this about five times. Amazing. Like talking to an automated attendant who can&#039;t understand what you&#039;re saying.

Don&#039;t explain anything, or it just takes longer

            <Content>When I called to cancel years back, it was fairly simple, only a few minutes total. Probably after that bad press they got that you see in the video they eased up.

But in like 1996 when i called to cancel the free hours I got for the microsoft network, it took maybe 15 minutes before she would just cancel it. For some reason I had to give a explanation for canceling that makes that AOL video seem like nothing.</Content>

            <Content>John Thom I just love your answer !! and it is soo effective.
I found AOL soo invasive
and with cancelling, they just sit in your neck and dont get off.
One almost has to be rude.
So, your answer is : THE ONLY ANSWER !!!</Content>
