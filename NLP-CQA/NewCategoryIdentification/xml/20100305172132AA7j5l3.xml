    <ChosenAnswer>If you just click on pay for item won it will guide you through it. You will have the option to pay as guest with a card, or  you can pay with paypal. When you choose to pay with paypal it will give you the option to open an account. When you open an account, paypal will make 2 deposites into the account you use. You will have to find out what those 2 deposites are and finish setting up the account. However, as guest you can pay imediately.</ChosenAnswer>
