Start&gt;Run

type CMD

in the command promt, type the following

ipconfig /release

(dont forget the space, and press enter)
A bit of shenanigans will happen, once complete type in the following

ipconfig /renew

    use the following 
       username:- admin
       password:- admin
4.a page will open there is no common format of the page as different companies of routers have different pages.
5. there might be some button stating &quot;WAN&quot;  in this option you should look up for place  stating connection setting select the option stating &quot;ALWAYS ON&quot; 
6. click apply.

        <Answer>
            <Content>Find out the password for the wireless signal.
There are three passwords involved.
PW 1. The password to the wireless router set-up configuration
PW 2. The password to the wireless signal which configured in the router set-up.
PW 3. The password to the PC/laptop wireless set-up configuration

Normally, people don&#039;t set a password for PW3.

A wireless signal password is actually an encryption key. An encryption key provides the facility in encrypting/decrypting the wireless signal. The wireless signal is encrypted because you don&#039;t want unauthorised people to listen in to whatever you are doing.

I can think of a few reasons you don&#039;t know the wireless signal password and cannot access the password.

1. You own the wireless router. Someone set it up, created the signal key, and then entered the key in the laptop and PC wireless configuration. That someone could be a family member no longer in the household, a geeksquad you paid to set-up the wireless, a worker from the internet company.

2. You do not own the wireless router because you are sharing it with other people who helped  configure your laptop and PC. You have access to the router but don&#039;t know how to reset it and those people who know has no time to help you.

3. The desktop is connected directly to the router by ethernet cables and therefore do not require wireless, but you laptop require wireless.

Reset the router yourself and reset  the wireless signal key. The downside is you have to reconfigure your desktop to use the new signal key. Connect your laptop or PC directly to the router to reset the router signal key. If you don&#039;t know the configuration password, find out the model of the router and download the manual from the internet. The manual will tell you how to reset the router and what the default configuration password is. Normally, there is a pinhole in the router where you could poke a pin into it to reset the router.

I think all this might be too difficult for you, unless you wish to spend a whole day learning how to do it - it might be better to get a knowledgeable friend to do it for you.

But wait a minute, the problem could be much simpler than that and you don&#039;t have to go thro all the reset trouble. There is a switch in your laptop which lets you turn the use of wireless off. This switch is provided to help laptop owners save battery power. This is a rather common mistake that you somehow managed to disable the use of the wireless card in your laptop but did not realise you have turned it off.

The switch could be a software switch, a hard switch somewhere under your laptop, a function key or a combination of those switches.

Find out if your wireless card on your laptop has been disabled on operating system&#039;s wireless configuration. Re-enable it.

Is you laptop configured to automatically disable wireless when battery power runs low - then plug the laptop in to recharge the battery.</Content>
