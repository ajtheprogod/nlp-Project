    <Subject>I&#039;m designing a weebly website for girls and women .. any tips?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m designing a weebly website for girls and women .. I&#039;ve never created or designed a website or a blog before but I&#039;ve this idea of a website for women and girls with articles about every thing that interest us like style, home, make up, etiquette .... etc with videos and photos .. and I thought I can create a weebly website for this cause it&#039;s easy to design and doesn&#039;t need experience ..

so any suggestions, opinions , tips , thoughts .. is it a good idea?
@JIM
I and my friends already have a facebook group for girls only .. we post a lot of articles that we write by ourselves .. we have like 800 female member (I don&#039;t know if 800 is a big number or not but for me it&#039;s ok since we are a closed group and we don&#039;t accept any request ) so It will not be just copy and paste .. I&#039;m just asking because blogs and websites are very different from facebook groups

    <ChosenAnswer>Seems like much of your content - the videos, photos, and possibly even the text - will simply be content copied from other sites.  If this is the case, this would be regarded as theft, simply because the content is not your own personally created content.
I only make this assumption due to your admission that you have never previously created a website</ChosenAnswer>
