    <Subject>Where can I find a free forum or how can I create a blog where I can post/host several 18+ art?</Subject>
    <Content>I have tons of fan made and professional made 18+ art (drawings, sketches, animated pictures, etc.) stored in my computer.
Where can I find a forum or something like it to easily share all those pictures for free?
Or how can I make an accessible blog with the common 18+ Warning where I can host the images for free?

            <Content>Free sites are much too limited in their bandwidth allotment to make it useful to you.  You would run out of your allotment before the first day was over!</Content>
