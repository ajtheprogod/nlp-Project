    <ChosenAnswer>I took care of this problem several years ago. I dropped IE and went with Mozilla Firefox. It is so much better than IE, no crashes, great updates, good spam control, excellent pop-up window control and lots of ways to personalize. Or you could try Google Chrome, it is pretty good too.</ChosenAnswer>
