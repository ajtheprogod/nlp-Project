    <Subject>help with eBay?? Quick Pleasee?</Subject>
    <Content>well this is like my first time using eBay. and i want to buy this poster. so if i press &quot;buy now&quot; does that mean that its mine and it will be shipped to me? or can other people still bid on it? I dont want to be spending more money than i should be. or be owing somebody money that i don&#039;t know.

    <ChosenAnswer>buy it now is exactly what it sounds like.  you are buying the item, therefore taking it off the market and other people cannot bid on it.</ChosenAnswer>
