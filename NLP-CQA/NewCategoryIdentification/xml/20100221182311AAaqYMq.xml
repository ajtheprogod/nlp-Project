    <ChosenAnswer>The site is NOT legitimate. Please stay away from it. It is used by fake employers to try and steal people&#039;s information.
First, the fake employer offers you a job - The employer might even have a website, making the company look real. However,you should look for tell-tale signs like: a company phone number that nobody ever answers, or an address with only a street number (no city or state), or anything that your instincts point out to you.

Once the fake employer expresses interest in hiring or interviewing you, they ask you to submit your credit score to them. Not the report, just the score. They sometimes claim that they want to know your score to see whether you are responsible with money, since you may be handling company money and credit cards. You are told you can explain a low credit score at the interview. 

They then suggest that you use a site that they recommend, in order to check the score. They tell you the site is free or quick or easy, and it looks as though they are helping you and making things easier. You are also told to not delay, since it will slow down the job application process.

However, DO NOT USE THE SUGGESTED SITES. They are fraudulent, and are only set up to steal your information!! This will include your social security number and other very precious information! 

Trust the 3 main credit reporting bureaus for your credit report / score. Do NOT put yourself at RISK. It&#039;s not worth it. Your bank may also be able to provide your score to you. 

Don&#039;t fall victim to these scams in your sincere quest to find employment.
Best of luck to you. I hope you find a fabulous job!! (in spite of all these annyoing scammers)</ChosenAnswer>
