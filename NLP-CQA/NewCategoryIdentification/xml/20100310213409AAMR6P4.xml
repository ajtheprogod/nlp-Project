  <Question id="20100310213409AAMR6P4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Do you have a blog? What&#039;s your favorite thing about blogging?</Subject>
    <Content>What&#039;s blogging like? I&#039;m new to it!! Do you enjoy it? Should i give it a go?

I just made a blog! http://elwingtaralom.blogspot.com

I&#039;m going to do a series where I blog about each year of my life, as well as the things most important to me (e.g. MUSIC), and then proceed to random daily/weekly blog posts :)

Blogging seemed appealing to me as a way to express myself without anyone knowing who I REALLY was (like my real name, etc.). I can vent.

Do you have a blog? Post the link!!

:)
Thank you Web Social Mama! I just did a new post...and you are my first blog follower!! Thanks so much for the advice too. :)

    <ChosenAnswer>Go for it! It&#039;s fun and it gives you a lot of insight into yourself and whatever is going on around you at the time. I just went over and followed your new blog and I see that you&#039;re already off to a strong start, so just keep doing what you&#039;re doing and, above all...

Enjoy yourself and say whatever you feel like saying.

            <Content>Blogging is a great way to express yourself. You can make small posts that just touch upon something or you can make in-depth posts discussing your view about something.

I will strongly recommend you to keep to a theme. If it is your personal blog, you should write about things that touch your life. Like years of your life, things you are passionate about, business you do, ethics you follow etc. If it is your business blog, talk about your clients, your products, ways to use your products and get more out of it, interesting cases you have recently handled, awards you have won etc.

Give it your personal voice. It is ok to post about something that has appeared elsewhere as long as you are adding your touch on to it (comments, how it applies to your industry or geography).

I can assure you - you will fall in love with blogging soon.</Content>
