    <ChosenAnswer>Delivered means delivered.

If the UPS or Fed Ex tracking system says it was delivered and you do not have it, you need to contact them directly and find out where it is.  If they left it on your door step, it may have been stolen.  Most likely though it is waiting at the closest shipping center.</ChosenAnswer>
