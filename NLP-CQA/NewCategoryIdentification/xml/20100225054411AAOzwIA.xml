  <Question id="20100225054411AAOzwIA" type="Answered">
    <Subject>What can you tell me about Star Trek Official Fan Club?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a friend who&#039;s told me that if you pay a $24.99 joining fee and stay a member for a year, you can apply for a $300 scholarship for wherever you&#039;re going. This sounds fantastic, to me, so if anyone can give me a few more details or tips on how to navigate the site I would really appreciate it. I keep getting so lost there and I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m supposed to do.
