    <ChosenAnswer>Sounds as if this member has broken Ebay rules and Ebay has removed them. They won&#039;t be paying for your item. 

Go into &quot;My Ebay&quot; and &quot;items sold&quot;. You will see the item you have sold and at the end of the line click on the drop down menu and choose &quot;report a problem&quot; and go from there.  You report that the buyer is no longer registered with Ebay.  Ebay will cancel the sale and you won&#039;t have to pay a Final Value fee which depending on the value of the item can be quite high. 

You can then use the relist item function to relist the item if you want to try selling it again or offer it as a second chance offer to the next bidder (if you used an auction style format).</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>report the non payment to ebay via the &#039;report a problem&#039;  option - they will contact the buyer to request payment, if they don&#039;t hear from them you will be refunded your listing fee.

It doesn&#039;t seem like you are going to get paid for the item so you will have to relist it</Content>

            <Content>Well if they&#039;re no longer registered you will get a refund of your FVF. I&#039;m afraid you will have to either offer a second chance offer to the next bidder down the list or re insert the auction</Content>
