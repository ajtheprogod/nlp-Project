    <ChosenAnswer>The other person put in a &quot;proxy bid&quot;, which is a hidden high bid.

Say he bid $10, but it only shows him at $2.

So you bid $3... and ebay instantly bumps him up to $4.

You bid $5, and ebay bumps him up to $6.

And so on until he is at his highest bid ($10 in this case).

So... it&#039;s ebay bumping up his bids. The other guy isn&#039;t sitting there doing it.</ChosenAnswer>
