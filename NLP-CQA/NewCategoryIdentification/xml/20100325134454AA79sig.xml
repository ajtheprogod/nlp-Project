    <ChosenAnswer>That&#039;s why Craigslist is face to face. You are not supposed to ship or accept shipments on Craigslist.
Any ad that you reply to where the seller won&#039;t deal face to face IS A SCAM and should be reported immediately.

You deal face to face and if the deal doesn&#039;t look good, walk away.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You don&#039;t know for sure.  There is no rating system like ebay.

You have to take precautions to prevent being defrauded.  Don&#039;t wire money, etc.

Do another search for the same person and see how many places (cities) has the same listing.  If they are very far away then could be something fishy.</Content>
