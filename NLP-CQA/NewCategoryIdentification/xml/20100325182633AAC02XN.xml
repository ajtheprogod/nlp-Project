    <ChosenAnswer>If an ebay gift card then contact ebay.  If a paypal gift card then contact paypal.  You never said what gift card.  I know someone with a walmart gift card that tried to pay his bar tab with it.  You could be an employee that wrote down gift card numbers then sold them to customers.  That is why they want credit card info for security purposes.  It leaves a paper trail in case you stole it.
I had a customer try to settled his bar tab with a credit card and had no signature on the back.  I asked for some id.  He refused and I refused to give it back to him.  Cops came and it turned out to be his brotherinlaws card.</ChosenAnswer>
