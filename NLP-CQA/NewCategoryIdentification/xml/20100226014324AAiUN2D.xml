  <Question id="20100226014324AAiUN2D" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Does Anybody know what Domain Registrar will release Domain Names immediately after purchase?</Subject>
    <Content>What im asking is where can I purchase a domain name, which i can sell almost immediately and transfer it to the new owner straight away, for example godaddy.com wont allow a transfers for 60 days after purchasing, which can be a pain if you want to sell immediately.

p.s. If there ain&#039;t any then which has the smallest release time?

    <ChosenAnswer>Assuming your domain name is a .com, .net, .org the 60 day rule exists with all registrars.

While you may not be able to perform a registrar transfer of a new domain for 60 days you can still &quot;push&quot; the name to a different registrant account at the same registrar. 

If you sell the domain within the 60 days your buyer will simply need to open an account with GoDaddy (if he/she doesn&#039;t already have one) and you can transfer the domain into his/her account. The transfer restriction only relates to a transfer between registrars, not registrants.

Good luck with your sale.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>The law prohibits transfers on domains less than 60 days old.

In accordance with ICANN rules, you cannot transfer your domain to another provider until 60 days after your domain registration date</Content>
