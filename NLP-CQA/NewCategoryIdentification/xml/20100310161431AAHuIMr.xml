    <ChosenAnswer>Maybe the server is having trouble, in which case all you can do is wait.

They don&#039;t seem to have a separate status server (which usually inform visitors of downtime), so it&#039;s anyone&#039;s guess as to what is going on.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>have yuh talked to Zwinky SUPPORT yet? Email them!!! I have had the same problem...Have you tried turning your computer on and off? My guess is that your downloading from the wrong site. I mean it LOOKS like the real Zwinky, but it&#039;s not. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll work, but you can try.
1. Uninstall it.
2. Search in Google: Zwinky
3. You will see the options, DO NOT CLICK ON THIS ONE:
Zwinky
www.zwinky.com/ - Cached - Similar
Sign In
Zwinky Home Page
Zwinky Manual Install
More results from zwinky.com Â»

As you can see it has www.zwinky.com/ instead of www.Zwinky.com You are understand? xD
So go to the one ABOVE that, (the on in the yellowy sort of rectangle.) Looks like this:

www.Zwinky.com      Create your own Zwinky - Now! Explore the world of Zwinktopia.

You might wanna check your computer for malware or a trojan! OR A WOOOORM, (viruses) If you have download from www.zwinky.com/ kay? And just to be sure have a scan after downloading.

When I downloaded from there (www.zwinky.com/) my Antivira came up nd said MALWARE
DETECTED, So beware from       THIS^^^. D:
Mkay? Still doesn&#039;t work, go to support and email them. You also might not have enough space on yer disk, so go to START then Control Panel then Add Or Remove Progams then just make a bit of space. HOPE THIS HEEEEELPED&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Dx</Content>
