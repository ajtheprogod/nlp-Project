    <ChosenAnswer>I use Swagbucks its much easier no offers to do or games to play just use their search engine. It&#039;s like google but you get &quot;swagbucks&quot; which you exchange for prizes. I got $50 in amazon gift cards in the past 2 months from them.

Edit: DON&#039;T use lockerz, you can get points easily but they are almost never in stock and their prizes run out very quickly so it is almost impossible to get anything.</ChosenAnswer>
