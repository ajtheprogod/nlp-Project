  <Question id="20100313202733AAz8Xye" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How Can I Find A Yahoo Users Email Address?</Subject>
    <Content>I am just not internet savvy! I checked the Yahoo whatchamajig and they list a &quot;user name&quot; for an old friend of mine after I put in his real name. &quot;Tonguewrestler&quot; came up....LOL...But that is not his email address@Yahoo.com.
How can I get it?
We haven&#039;t talked in about 8 years and I would like to send him an email.
Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>you cannot search the yahoo Email address Directory 
Yahoo protects it&#039;s user&#039;s privacy 

Try to search in google with his name or any info you know 
and see what you get

if you are lucky then you will get his mail
