            <Content>I am sad you felt the need to change your name, but this will never change the person for if I was close I would come to the office and help. Relax your mind and enjoy the Gift of life.</Content>

            <Content>Hi,

If you have lost the document showing your name change or want to revert back to your birth name you can do this through a Deed Poll document. It is a relatively cheap process and will show your name change from your current name back to your former name or another name of your choice.

You can apply for a Deed Poll document online for as little as Â£29. If you cannot find your just order another one. Probably be a lot less stressful than hunting all over the place for yours!

Check out this site for more info:

It can all be done over the internet as well which will be easier probably-hope this helps

Good Luck</Content>
