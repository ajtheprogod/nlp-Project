    <ChosenAnswer>It looks like there&#039;s a full user guide on the cd that came with your phone according to this video here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvrRfH1iPQ&amp;feature=channel

Also, could you be more specific? Connection issues are a dime a dozen thousand. There are usually so many possibilities that without a good understanding of the problem (i.e. the step by step process it took to derive the problem) it becomes nearly impossible to offer a solution.</ChosenAnswer>
