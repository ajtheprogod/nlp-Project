  <Question id="20100320061101AAgtAcK" type="Answered">
    <Subject>is mobile broadband any good?</Subject>
    <Content>My contract ends with AOL next week and I really want a new laptop but can;t afford one at the moment so was thinking about mobile broadband with a free laptop in the offer. But my mate has T-Mobile and it&#039;s a nightmare, the pictures are of very poor quality and it&#039;s sooo slowly and so bad I&#039;d rather have no internet at all. Just wondering if any of them networks are better or even better than home broadband. 

Thanx :)

            <Content>I can watch streaming video (YouTube, MySpace etc.) smoothly with mobile broadband.
Assuming you&#039;re in the UK, check Vodafone out as their monthly plan offers a mobile broadband speed double any of the others and double the speed of any prepay mobile broadband</Content>

            <Content>Wired is still cheaper and faster (Comcast, Etc.).

Image quality won&#039;t be affected by mobile but it will be slower (It will be hard to play multiplayer games online). 

I wouldn&#039;t recommend mobile broadband as a replacement for home highspeed unless you travel a lot and need internet everywhere.</Content>

If so, go for 3 network. I use it. You actually get free broadband for a year, you top-up like you would a mobile phone [it has a sim card] and you can send texts on it. It has fast connection.
