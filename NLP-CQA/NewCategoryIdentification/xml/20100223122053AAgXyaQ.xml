    <Subject>Need help choosing a blog name/url :]?</Subject>
    <Content>So I was planning on opening a blog of basically my life for anyone else to read, so I made some polls to choose the URL and they simply said that guys typically don&#039;t like blogs anyways, so I was thinking: hey, why don&#039;t I wrote a blog about my life and have it aimed towards girls? Girls could read it and I think that would be sort of cool? So I&#039;m not positive but if you could please give me some url ideas or some nice key words for it that&#039;d be great. 

Some ideas for topics:
Funny Stuff
Entertainment
Q&amp;A
Other

Some url ideas:
LifeInOurEyes.com
have a catchy name in mind?

    <ChosenAnswer>If you want to attract girls to your blog, you better know about shoes! 
And hair. And gossip. And crappy movies. And feelings. And vampires.

K just kidding lol. But if you&#039;re going to invest the effort in doing a blog, you better have some good, interesting content - a lot of it. And fresh stuff every day to get them coming back every day. And a comments section, to get feedback &amp; make them feel like a part of it. And imbedded YouTube vids always helps...if they are good. There&#039;s nothing worse than lame YouTube vids.
