    <Subject>Why am I getting referrers on wordpress from random facebook links?</Subject>
    <Content>Wordpress offers referrers in your stats, meaning it shows where people clicked your link to get there. I am finding that links from random pages on facebook, friends pages or fan pages, where my link is not posted are appearing quite frequently. Anyone know why?
