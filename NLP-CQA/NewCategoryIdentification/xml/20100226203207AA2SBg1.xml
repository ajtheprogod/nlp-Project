    <Subject>Trouble signing into AOL?</Subject>
    <Content>About 5-6 hours ago I attempted to sign into my AOL email address, but it wouldn&#039;t let me on and said that the password or screen name was wrong. I tried a couple of times just to make sure I wasn&#039;t making a typo. I also tried to sign onto AIM which has the password saved. Nothing worked. I called a friend and got him to try signing on for me and he was unable to. However, in the last hour or so it has started working again.

I&#039;m curious as to whether other AOL users have experienced this recently, or if perhaps I should be worried about a hacker.
