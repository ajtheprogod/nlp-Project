    <ChosenAnswer>I got the same thing. Its probably a one time thing. I don&#039;t know what the purpose of the spoof email is though? Scammers are trying to capitalize on the popularity of Amazon right now I guess. Somebody who actually did order something might panic and click on that website. But I guess maybe its just spyware or maybe a virus if you click on the website?</ChosenAnswer>
