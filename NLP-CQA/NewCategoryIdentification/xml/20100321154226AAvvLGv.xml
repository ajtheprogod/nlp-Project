        <Answer>
            <Content>Here are the pros and cons of the two:

Firefox pros:
* Infinitely more customizable, akin to the apple adage &quot;there&#039;s an app for that&quot;, for anything you want to do in Firefox, &quot;there&#039;s an addon for that&quot;.
* The gecko rendering engine obeys internet standards far more accurately and renders pages far more quickly than internet explorer. For immediately visible results, you&#039;ll see almost all the pages you browse to look better and load faster.
* Far more security than internet explorer, and a pop up block that actually works most of the time.

Firefox cons:
* Depending on how many addons you get, it could get a little bulky, and start taking up a lot of RAM.
* Takes longer to boot up than internet explorer, but once you start it up, it is a lot faster. (On slower machines, I generally just open it up and keep it open, unless I am forced to close it).

Internet Explorer pros:
* Takes slightly less time to boot up than Firefox.

Internet Explorer cons:
* Is the spawn of Satan.</Content>

            <Content>I&#039;d give Jason J three thumbs up if Yahoo would allow me, simply because &quot;Spawn of Satan&quot; is three words!

However, for the record - Internet Explorer 8 supports ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) tags better than Firefox.

Hey, IE has to win SOMETHING!</Content>
