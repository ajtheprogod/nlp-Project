            <Content>Well dude.  I thought I was going to be able to just whip though my profile settings and find a place to do a delete.  But I guess there isn&#039;t one.  Or maybe I&#039;m not knowing where to look (probably).

I know there is a way to do it because I have clicked on old contacts and seen the message &quot;oops this account is gone&quot; or words to that effect.

I would try and contact Yahoo support on this one.</Content>
