  <Question id="20100306114237AAn0baA" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I have an Internet Connection but trouble surfing the web?</Subject>
    <Content>I have an internet connection.  My computer stats show that the wireless signal strength from my router to my laptop is excellent.  I can download things at normal to high speeds at all times.  However, surfing the actual internet on different sites is very difficult.  More often than not, when I try to go to any website, it says its connecting for a while and then gives up saying either that it couldn&#039;t connect and I should check my internet connection or the webpage is unavailable or that the link is broken.  I know I have a connection because like I said before, downloading remains unaffected.  And I can&#039;t believe that every webpage is unavailable or broken almost all the time.  Does anyone know what the problem could be?

            <Content>Browse using different web browser Firefox, google chrome etc.  I personally do not use Internet Explorer.
Other thing you can do is - restart the router (power off and back on again) and right button click on your &#039;wireless network&#039; and click on &#039;repair&#039;.  It will remove any proxy settings that you may have!
