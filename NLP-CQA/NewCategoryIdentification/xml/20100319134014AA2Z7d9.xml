    <ChosenAnswer>Totally Agree w/ surfsup I mean seriously why not take the add down, I think its because they figure hey i sold the &quot;item&quot; and now i just don&#039;t have to bother taking the sign down because i got what i wanted! 

Or possibly its because they want to see what someone else would have paid or how many other people wanted what they were selling. . .
