    <ChosenAnswer>Picnic? If that is the photo editing site, why would it want access to your email account? From my experience, it&#039;s not a dangerous site.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Any reputable website will not require you to give them access to your account - such as passwords. You should be able to use their service without giving them the details

These are often asked for to advertise it&#039;s service to your friends - you will be responsible for their spam! So don&#039;t give them the details (same as Facebook and similar - they ask for e-mail passwords so they can send e-mails to your contacts who arn&#039;t signed up)</Content>
