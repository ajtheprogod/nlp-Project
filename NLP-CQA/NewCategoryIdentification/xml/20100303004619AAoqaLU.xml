    <ChosenAnswer>Maybe she&#039;s a little put off by it because she hasn&#039;t used it yet and doesn&#039;t know what to expect.  Maybe if you sit with her and tweet a couple of times so she can see how it&#039;s done, and see how people respond, etc., she&#039;ll be more comfortable with it and be more willing to join. Other than that, if she ends up not wanting to, then it just ain&#039;t her thing.  :)</ChosenAnswer>
