    <Subject>Wireless internet broadband - wireless needs more distance into back yard? How to?</Subject>
    <Content>Hi there. I need some ideas as how to extend the distance of my wireless internet broadband. We have a relo moving into the back yard garage and they need access to the internet.. At the moment there is a slight signal which is barely worth it and that was with the door open..

We can&#039;t run the phone line or anything out there.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated :)

    <ChosenAnswer>To increase the range of wireless , you need to buy a strong wifi router or modem. That is the permanent solution.

You can also improve the WIFI signal by keeping the access point on a higher surface. You can even hang it on the wall ( using nails )and make sure that the antennae is at a position higher. This may increase the signal a bit but i don&#039;t think there would be any considerable improvement.</ChosenAnswer>
