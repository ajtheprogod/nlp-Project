    <Subject>Bought Mp3s from amazon but I had a payment problem...?</Subject>
    <Content>Well yes I bought an mp3 and that went through fine I did the whole one click buy but then I bought two more and put them in my basket first. I should&#039;ve had enough money for all 3 if only just on my card. I&#039;m going to get a mini statememnt tomorrow to see if I&#039;ve been charged.but I got this in an e-mail.
&quot;We are writing to let you know that we have not received a valid payment method for the above order (order number here) and it is now cancelled. Please note you will need to place a new order for the item(s) you wished to purchase. &quot; 
Since they&#039;re mp3s I&#039;ve already got them so I don&#039;t see how it can be cancelled?
Do I need to put money in my bank again or maybe even buy them again?

    <ChosenAnswer>If you go to the the account section, there should be a link to digital orders. If you look there, it should list all the ones that you&#039;re having problems with. You can open up each order and select another method of payment there.

As you already have a copy of the mp3s the payment problem won&#039;t stop you from keeping them, but until it&#039;s fixed you won&#039;t be allowed to buy more. Furthermore, they will be entitled to come after you for the money you still owe them, as you have the product and you haven&#039;t paid for it.</ChosenAnswer>
