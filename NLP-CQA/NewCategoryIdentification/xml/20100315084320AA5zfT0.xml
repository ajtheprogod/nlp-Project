  <Question id="20100315084320AA5zfT0" type="Answered">
    <Subject>One specific site won&#039;t load in my laptop (and in my laptop alone)?</Subject>
    <Content>It&#039;s livejournal. And anything that has to do with it (communities, personal journals, icons being hosted by livejournal etc.)

The thing is, it loads really, REALLY slowly on my laptop. It&#039;s either I get frustrated and stop loading it altogether, or wait for it (usually takes around five minutes to load the sign in page), and then be greeted by what looks like a half-loaded site (broken html format, images not showing up, all text in Times New Roman).

Here are the other circumstances:
1.) Already tried to access livejournal in different browsers (IE, FF, and Chrome to be exact) in my laptop, and all loaded Livejournal very slowly.
2.) I tried to access livejournal using the same connection (at home, which is the one I&#039;m using right now) through my ipod and desktop, and livejournal loaded there just fine. Mind you, my connection is pretty fast.
3.) I tried to access livejournal using a different connection, and livejournal loaded properly.
4.) Tried turning off utorrent (the only thing that I could think of that could be slowing down my connection - which, to be honest, has yet to occur before) and loading livejournal, still nothing. Other sites still work, regardless of utorrent running or not.

I&#039;ve already tried the following solutions, to no avail:
1.) clear my cache/cookies/history for ALL of my browsers.
2.) used /flushdns
3.) check if livejournal is undergoing maintenance (and no, they are not).

Other sites are working as they should, without showing signs of slowing down. It&#039;s just Livejournal specifically that&#039;s wounding up wrong.

Oddly enough, there are random (short) moments where livejournal would just load fine. And then I click on another page (comments), and it&#039;s back to loading really slowly again.

I don&#039;t know what to do anymore :(
