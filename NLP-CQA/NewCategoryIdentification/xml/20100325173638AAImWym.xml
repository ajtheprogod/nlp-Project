  <Question id="20100325173638AAImWym" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is there a site that you can make your videos private, but viewable on another site?</Subject>
    <Content>I have a loyal fan base on YouTube that have said they love my videos, So I was thinking about having a website that has all my videos,  but is there a website that you can upload videos on, that can be set to private, so you can only see them on my site?

I have tried it with YouTube and it does not work. It would be pointless to have the videos public, so you could see them on YouTube and my site.
