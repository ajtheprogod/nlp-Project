    <Subject>Ed, Edd and Eddy 4chan Screen Capture? L is for the way...?</Subject>
    <Content>I remember seeing this Ed Edd and Eddy screen capture on 4chan
Where it was like
&quot;L is for the way you look at me&quot;
&quot;O is for the only one I see&quot;
&quot;V is very very, extraorinary&quot;

Then theres a picture of Eddy and it says something like
&quot;A is for apples which is for helping people!&quot;

It was soo funny but I cant find the pic anywhere

Can and 4chaners help?

    <ChosenAnswer>am using this program to record my screen while I play games. 
Before Total Screen Recorder, I tried like 5 different softwares(including Frag,Camstudio, hypercam...) but I had many issues such as the game is recorded in the corner of the video with these program, the video is so blurry, and constant skipping on the playback of the video because the software can not record fast enough to keep up with the game. 
Total Screen Recorder is an awesome software that I can use to record my game without all those annoying crap recording problems. Good Luck!
