    <ChosenAnswer>Dear Amber,

You can do a keyword search like &quot;how to write interesting blogs&quot; and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll come up with some helpful sites.

Do you have a topic chosen yet?  Have you started your blogsite yet?

I am an expert at internet marketing, and I am sure your next question after getting started writing will be, &quot;how do I get blog traffic?&quot;.

In anticipation, here is how to get started, although there is much more you can do to become well known online.  Just start with this:

Use Twitter and Facebook to start your online marketing for your blog. Learn Twitter first, then Facebook.

Use your common sense in inviting friends. You are looking for people who have your blog topic on their minds. Do searches in Twitter and Facebook to find those who are into it. 

This should keep you busy for awhile learning and setting up those venues. 

Start slow with the invites. Google will shut you down if you are inviting too many people per day.

Twitter: Do not follow more than 10% over the number of people who follow you. 

Facebook: Take it easy here, too. Also, when you invite, be sure to give each person a personal message: 

&quot;Hi, Josh, I see you are interested in &quot;your topic&quot;. So am I. Let&#039;s connect.&quot; I&#039;ll talk to you soon, Amber.

On both venues, do 15-20 minutes per day of inviting.

I have much more to share when you are ready.

I learned these techniques through my coaches and mentors, who encourage me to help others.

Let&#039;s talk soon,
