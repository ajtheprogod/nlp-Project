  <Question id="20100314153706AAR0w9T" type="Answered">
    <Subject>is there a way to trace the origins of a picture...?</Subject>
    <Content>I don&#039;t really know how to ask this...but...I suppose I&#039;ll start by trying to give a scenario;

let&#039;s say...someone steals a picture of mine of off facebook or myspace or WHATEVER. they show it to someone else who has no connections to me whatsoever.

is there a way for that person to trace that picture and find it somewhere on the internet? only having that said picture as a resource.


like...you know?
