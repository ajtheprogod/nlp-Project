    <Subject>Can i change the shipping time on something I bought?</Subject>
    <Content>I bought something on amazon, and I now want to change the shipping time to make it come faster! Could I still do that?
I am getting it through Amazon and they are going to ship it tommorow...so would i still be able to change it?
Never mind turns out they already shipped it!

    <ChosenAnswer>If you bought it from Amazon themselves and not a merchant, and it hasn&#039;t shipped yet, yes.
If it&#039;s already shipped, you&#039;re out of luck.
If it&#039;s with a merchant you need to email them to reorder with expedited.</ChosenAnswer>
