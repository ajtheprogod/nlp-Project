            <Content>No, your wireless at home IS WiFi.  You are not connecting to it properly, there is most likely a WEP security encryption on your home WiFi.  You need to program your IPhone to work with it.</Content>

            <Content>Hi Nathan

Well WiFi is a networking standard;
when you use WiFi you are connecting to something called a Wireless Access Point or (WAP)
this is then connected to the &quot;internet&quot; via wires and cables.
Your &quot;WAP&quot; is your Home router, which has a range of about  30 -90 Meters

Your Computer &lt;--WiFi--&gt; WAP (Wireless Access Point) &lt;--Cables--&gt; &quot;The internet&quot;

WiFi is the connection between your computer and the WAP by using radio waves

hope this helps

Sy
