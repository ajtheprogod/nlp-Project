    <Subject>Cute little hearts on picnik?</Subject>
    <Content>ok so i use picnik to edit my pictures, it does a pretty good job for a sort of free photo editing site.  so my friend edits her pictures and she always has this heart on there and i think its really cute but i cant seem to find it on picnik, and i know for a fact that she doesnt have premium, but i cant seem to find the heart anywhere on the site. it looks like a &quot;hand drawn&quot; heart but its not under that section, thats premium though so she couldnt have gotten it there, and it it kind of on an angle, just slightly. I&#039;ve been looking everywhere for it on the site, and im quite possitive that she doesnt use any other editing site. thanx!
