  <Question id="20100228052918AAisofZ" type="Answered">
    <Subject>I am looking to buy traffic for my site. For now, I&#039;m considering bringvisitor.com. Are there any other sites?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m quite a n00b, so I&#039;m not familiar with other sites selling cheap traffic.
I&#039;d really appreciate your help.

Thank you!

    <ChosenAnswer>I would say that you should leave whatever traffic sites there are because that traffic might not be as good as others like Googld Adwords(or adsense). They provide all the graphs and you pay per click. Not per 1000 customers.</ChosenAnswer>
