    <Subject>Why won&#039;t my wireless internet work on my laptop but it will on my sisters?</Subject>
    <Content>Earlier it was her laptop that wasn&#039;t connecting to the wireless but now it is mine. This happened about 2 months ago and I called netgear and they fixed it and so I called again but they said I only had one free call? and told me to buy a new one EVEN THOUGH it can be fixed. Pleeeease does anyone know how to get my laptop connected to wireless?
It says wireless networks are available and when I go to click on netgear to connect it says windows cannot connect to netgear
the model is RANGEMAX WIRELESS ROUTER
