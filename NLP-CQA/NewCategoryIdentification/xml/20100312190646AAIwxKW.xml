    <ChosenAnswer>Use an external CD/DVD drive.  Downloading Windows 7 is illegal and you wouldn&#039;t be able to install it like that anyway.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>oh i hate laptops without dvd drives. 

But luckily theres a solution. It will require more purchusing thou.

What you need is an usb external dvd writer. These arn&#039;t to expensive but depends where you buy them.
you should be able to buy them from any good eletronic or computer shop

there are ways to downlaod them online but it&#039;s highly illegal and i wouldnt recommend it. Getting the usb  DVD drive is a lot easier and safer.

i hope this helps</Content>
