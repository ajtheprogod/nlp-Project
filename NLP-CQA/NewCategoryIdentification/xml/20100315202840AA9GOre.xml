    <ChosenAnswer>It might be your internet connection and not the Firefox Browser. That used to happen to me until I made several changes. I, too, have CCleaner and one of the changes I made was to stop deleting the Internet Cache, Internet History, Compact Databases and everything else under Firefox. I don&#039;t know but hopefully you solve that annoying problem.

-Update-
One temporary fix I made was to refresh the page and if that didn&#039;t work then I would go back and retry the link.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Sounds like the server is timing out. It doesn&#039;t sound like the problem is on your end at all. When you time out then click the back button, you are sending out another HTTP request and with a little luck the new request goes through without a hitch. SO don&#039;t worry, the problem is very probably the server and not you.</Content>
