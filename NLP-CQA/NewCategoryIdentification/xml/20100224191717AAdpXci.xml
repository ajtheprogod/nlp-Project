    <Subject>Blocking on Formspring.me?</Subject>
    <Content>I learned that by clicking the &quot;Spam&quot; button on a question on Formspring, it apparently will block the person (or so the site says).  I was wondering if anyone knew if this holds true even if the user is anonymous?  Will it block their IP address or something?

Thanks!

    <ChosenAnswer>It will block the IP address. When they try to ask another question, it wills say invalid request - to make it look like it&#039;s just an error and they are not blocked.
They can unblock themselves by resetting their internet or going on another computer.

When they ask non-anonymous then it blocks their username.

When they ask anonymous, it blocks their IP because other than that their is no way to identify them.</ChosenAnswer>
