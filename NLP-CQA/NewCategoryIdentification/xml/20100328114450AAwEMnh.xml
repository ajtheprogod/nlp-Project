    <ChosenAnswer>- If your looking for a casual Email address try using his first and last name interceded by a dot or underscore then if that is taken add his favorite # or the # of his favorite soccer player. 
- If your looking for a cool email add: try adding a spice on his name like:
    tonioloco@domainname.com
    almightytony@domainname.com
- or try converting both your names:
    anathony@domainname.com

Play aroun w/it!
