    <ChosenAnswer>It depends what your considering inappropriate. If it&#039;s against the terms &amp; conditions of that site, then you should be able to email the site support and let them know. If it&#039;s just against your personal sensibilities, then just click elsewhere. There&#039;s a lot of things that some people find offensive that are not against the rules of the sites.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>All of those have links to &#039;report abuse&#039; or something similar.  Pictures, messages, etc., all of them have those places to click.

Be careful with that, though.  Make sure it&#039;s really inappropriate according to the community guidelines.  You can&#039;t just report messages or pictures you don&#039;t like.</Content>

            <Content>Report it - Each site will have a Page where you can report inappropiate stuff. If they will do nothing then e-mail the site/page/persons details to your local police</Content>
