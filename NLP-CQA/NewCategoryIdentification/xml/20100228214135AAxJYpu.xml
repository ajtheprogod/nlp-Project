    <Subject>How do I unsign an online petition?</Subject>
    <Content>Ok so a few years back I signed a petition on Care2.com and now I can not seem to get my signature removed, does anyone have any idea how I could do this??  It&#039;s quite aggravating.

I&#039;ve tried contacting customer service with a nice tone and everything.. they don&#039;t respond to e-mails their answering machine tells you that they won&#039;t respond to messages you leave.  Any suggestions on how to hide it from Google so it doesn&#039;t appear as the first thing under my name upon searching?

Thank you!!

    <ChosenAnswer>You can&#039;t really. Under the terms and conditions of Care2.com (if you read them) it clearly states that when you sign a petition you are entering into a contract which states that you&#039;re bound by your signature. Basically, you can&#039;t remove it.</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>you don&#039;t sign an online petition so it has no legal significance and few people will take it seriously , it is unlikely to appear on google unless they pay google to have it high in their search results</Content>
