    <ChosenAnswer>There are 3 way....
1) Go to (File2HD.com)
http://file2hd.com/Default.aspx

mark the video button and search the link. If it works then no prob. If it doesn&#039;t.... then

2) Download Ask Recorder. It can capture any video from any site. You have to watch the whole video and it&#039;ll be downloaded in the download folder and you can catch the path of the file.

3) Or you can just get the Audio by downloading Kate&#039;s Mp3 Recorder. It&#039;s easy. Not too much size.

I&#039;m sure either of above will solve. Try it step by step.</ChosenAnswer>
