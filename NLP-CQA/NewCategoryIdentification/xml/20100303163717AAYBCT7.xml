    <Subject>How can I start ebay merchanting?</Subject>
    <Content>I want to start merchenting on ebay. I want it only to be done with things bought on ebay, and I have $400 to start with. I tried reselling an NES but it was a fail the console went up to $100 and it didn&#039;t have any games (I planned on buying it cheap at its original price and buying some cheap NES games and reselling it)

    <ChosenAnswer>What you are asking for is EXTREMELY hard to do. In the best case scenario, you can buy an item for 10% less than how much you sell it for, and eBay fees and shipping fees will negate that profit! However, if you really adamant about merchanting, try searching for misspelled words, as those items will more than likely sell less. Buy from listings with no pictures (it is a risk, however!). You can also try collectibles or antiques. I did end up buying and reselling for more profit by accident one time on a collectible dress pattern. I bought it for $10 off eBay to make a dress. The person who got outbid messaged me asking if I could resell it on eBay after I finished using it because she really wanted it for her pattern collection (it was a 1980&#039;s dress pattern that was rare - I didn&#039;t get it for the collecting, I got it for the pattern). I agreed to relist it, and the auction ended up selling for $25. The shipping was pretty cheap, and the fees were not much, either, so it actually did end up profitable. The chance that something will happen to me again, however, is probably 1 in a million. Good luck!</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>Go to Craigslist.  You can buy an NES straight from the seller without bidding.  And they&#039;ll be local! :D</Content>
