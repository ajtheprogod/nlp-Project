    <ChosenAnswer>Merely being on Myspace should not create enough lag to interfere with World of Warcraft or other online games.  Are u sure he is not doing some other activity...such as downloading items from torrents or similar activities?

But to directly answer your question...Yes u can find his MAC address and ban it in the router&#039;s configuration screen.  The router should report the MAC address somewhere in its status reports so u can get it that way.  Routers differ on where this function is located, so u will have to browse the setup screens.</ChosenAnswer>
