            <Content>The only way to get into demonoid is to have a invitation code
it does say on the front page registration is closed come back later
but its been saying since they first opened so your best bet is to just get luck on the code
I wish I had a code to give you but I&#039;ve yet to receive any to invite people</Content>

            <Content>Demonoid is now open to the public for registrations so be quick.
If you&#039;re lucky enough to get in then you&#039;ll have to look out for an activation email that will be from gate_keeper and NOT Demonoid.
This can sometimes end up in your Spam folder so be sure to check there if you don&#039;t see it.
Please try and give back at least as much as you take so anything above 1.1 is always appreciated.</Content>
