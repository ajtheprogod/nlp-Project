  <Question id="20100304160632AAmUjz4" type="Answered">
    <Subject>Is my router why my internet refuses to work? or is Time Warner Cable a bad wireless provider?</Subject>
    <Content>I play online games, and I was trying to log in, but every time I try I get stuck at the loading screen with a &quot;Not Responding&quot; message and get &quot;Disconnected from the world server&quot;

Now, before I had this problem and I thought it was because I was too far away from my wireless router, things worked for a few days on my laptop but now its horrible.

It took me 45 minutes or so to log in yesterday, and it&#039;s almost been an hour today. Im using some sort of DLink router, do i need to get a better one? or is Time warner cable bad for wireless

Now, the family desktop runs my game just fine and it&#039;s a few years older than my laptop. (that was extra info incase that helps)

    <ChosenAnswer>well if your playing games you should always be on LAN(Hooked to your router with a cable instead of wireless) because no matter what ISP(Internet service Provider) you have, an LAN connection increases speed.  I have Time Warner Internet and my computer is ok on wireless.  I think the problem is your router.  OR maybe you live in a bad area.(Like you get a bad connection to Time Warner)I would try replacing the router first.</ChosenAnswer>
