  <Question id="20100225152022AA3KhUw" type="Answered">
    <Subject>How can I change my NAT type to &quot;open&quot;?</Subject>
    <Content>I&#039;m a PC gamer and I can&#039;t join my friend&#039;s party in MW2 due to my NAT type being &quot;strict&quot;. I have opened &quot;Computer&quot;, found &quot;Network&quot; and then found my router. In its &quot;properties&quot; I have all the details about it; &quot;Serial number&quot; and &quot;MAC address&quot; and other such random things.

Any useful suggestions would be appreciated.

    <ChosenAnswer>You need to know what you&#039;re talking about before asking the question.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation

Once you&#039;ve read that, read the router&#039;s manual.
If you have horrible Windows, you might have to configure the firewall there too, in which case, read the manual.

And one last thing, read the manual of the game.</ChosenAnswer>
