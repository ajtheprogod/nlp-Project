    <ChosenAnswer>Go to start =&gt; Run then in the box that appears, type cmd to open the command prompt.  Once it&#039;s loaded, type ipconfig and press return.  You&#039;ll get a whole load of text appears but you&#039;re looking for the line that says Default Gateway.  This is what you really changed your router to.

If that doesn&#039;t work, it should have a hard reset button, usually next to the power switch.  Hold this in until the lights all flash then wait until the modem restarts itself fully before re-connecting on 192.168.1.1</ChosenAnswer>

            <Content>You should be able to reset your modem to factory setting. There is probably a recessed button somewhere on the modem that you can push and make it reset itself.</Content>
